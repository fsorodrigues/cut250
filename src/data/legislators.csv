We know that it is states that lead the way. In Vermont we already have Act 48 on the books and we need to figure out how to fully fund it. In a time when Washington is increasingly volatile, it is up to the states to take the lead on issues like health care. Whether it is a coalition with other states or funding it within our state, figuring out how to fund it must be a priority. It is wrong that a system exists which only allows you to recover from an illness if you are wealthy enough to afford good health insurance and thus good treatment. In our state and our country, all people should be able to access health care. We should absolutely pass and sign into law universal primary care, but it should be seen as a stepping stone to fully funding the single payer system on our books - or creating a system that can be funded. We must choose in our state to ensure that all Vermonters have health care.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","We must support the strong education system that we have in this state, rather than undermine it. I have been extremely disappointed at Phil Scott's attacks on public schools, our teachers and our kids. When people all over this state are struggling with extreme poverty and opiate use disorder, it would be irresponsible to impose superfluous teacher to student ratios or underfund education. We of course can make improvements by implementing the Ethnic Studies Standard. This would require our schools to teach the real history of our state and nation as well as form a panel which will help identify areas in which our education system can be improved and welcoming to all. We can centralize services closer to schools. This will give families who need access, easier access to services and will alleviate teachers of the burden, which will give all of our kids a stronger education. It also will help to keep our small schools open. Education is an investment in the future of our state.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","As Governor, I would work immediately with the legislature in order to again pass many of the bills that were vetoed this year. A $15/hour minimum wage and Paid Family Medical Leave are vital to ensuring that low-income Vermonters have more money in their pockets and Vermont has a stronger tax base. When Vermonters have money to spend in their local business, our economy grows. We must work on a housing first model for homelessness as well as transforming the transportation systems. Yes, we need stronger internet access in rural areas, but this alone does not solve the very real problems that many Vermonters face or how it impacts our economy. When we build the economy from the bottom up, that is when we begin to see economic growth. Shame and stigma keep us from fixing many of the problems that are attached to poverty. While I believe there is a moral imperative to make these changes, it is important for Vermonters to know that there is also an economic imperative as well.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"It is imperative that we look at the long-term economic impact of our investments. It is great when our economy works in the short term, but, our policies must grow our economy for the next twenty and thirty years, not just the next three. This means solving some of the real problems in our state that ultimately cost us a lot of money when left unresolved. The real goal when it comes to state spending has to be in the expansion of the tax base and economic growth by utilizing resources that exist within our state. When we have a large, and expanding tax base, we are able to make smart investments to grow our economy. Some examples of places where investment will ultimately save money is the Opioid Epidemic, Renewable Energy, Homelessness, Economic Inequality, internet access, Education and Transportation. We need to begin to look at how investment can create revenue and put our resources where the outcome will be positive for both every day Vermonters and the state",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"The right of a child to live through their day, and the right of a parent to know their child is safe at school needs to be paramount as we make policy. As a mother and a teacher, I know that we must do what it takes to keep our children safe. For the second year in a row our children's life expectancy went down due to gun violence and opioid death, this is not acceptable. The bills signed into law this year were a good first step. I watched the debate, I heard the arguments against the bills; The bottom line is that these bills will not stop people from being able to hunt or protect themselves. I applaud the legislature on the hard work that they did this year. There is still work to be done and this was an excellent first step.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","On day one, I will begin to work with the legislature to reintroduce, pass, and finally sign many of the bills that were vetoed by Phil Scott including: A $15/hour minimum wage, Paid Family and Medical Leave, the Toxics Bill, the Opioid Company Tax Bill, and others. No one part of my platform is more important than another, these issues are intersectional. If we are not working on Environmental Justice then we are not working on Economic Justice, if we are not working on Racial Justice then we are not working on Gender Justice and Criminal Justice. While my priorities are Building a Bottom Up Economy, Supporting Education, Transforming Transportation and Healing the Opioid Epidemic, we cannot focus on one thing alone, it will take an intersectional focus in order to push any of these priorities forward.

 Christine's experience as head of VEC and her national prominence as an energy expert inspired her cinematographer son Derek to direct a documentary about her entitled Denial. While filming Denial in 2015, Christine made the decision, after years of holding it inside, to come out as her true self, a transgender woman, becoming the first business leader in the country to transition while in office.

The legislature has prepared a number of bills on this topic, many of which we could implement in a timely manner. At most this would be a 1.5percent increase in the payroll tax, most companies that currently cover primary care would functionally only see a 0.5percent increase. This will enable all Vermonters to access preventive and diagnostic care, resulting in healthier citizens and overall cost savings. Our long term goal must always be an improved medicare for all system. I would look to build a market and infrastructure with other states as Washington DC has proved unwilling and unable to deliver the reforms Vermonters so desperately need.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Communities must be empowered to make the critical decisions about their schools. Communities have the right to control their own destinies and not have it dictated for them from Montpelier. I have always believed that the best solutions arise from the people on the front lines - in this case, the teachers and school boards. School buildings represent a major piece of public infrastructure in rural communities. We must encourage the co-locating of services, such as pediatric care, family counseling, and child care wherever possible. Additionally, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to address child care needs and access to early childhood education - it's been proven that investments in this area save money down the road. Not only is it the moral thing to do, it's also fiscally prudent. I also believe we need to rework the statewide funding formula away from property taxes and towards an income based system. Vermont's education system is a resource we must preserve.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I am keenly aware of the situation facing rural Vermonters. VEC serves 18 of the 25 poorest communities in Vermont. I realized that raising our rates would have serious impacts on families' budgets. It is this awareness that has made me place rural economic development at the center of my platform. I have a detailed plan to get fiber optic cable to every home and business in Vermont, enabling many kinds of new economic activities in our rural communities. I believe that it is imperative we invest in our rural infrastructure. As I have looked at Vermont's urban centers, it has become readily apparent that we lack the housing stock and policies necessary to make these communities livable for all. I would look to increase the stock of affordable housing, as well as working with our housing trusts to increase access to vouchers and other subsidies. For all low income Vermonters, I strongly support raising the minimum wage. I will also work closely with communities to utilize TIF financing.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"My background is business so I look at a significant part of public spending through the lens of strategic investments. I will take the example of water, one dollar spent on water quality mitigation will save us three in the long run. Proper financial management looks at spending over the long term. I believe spending more now on water quality management will enable us to spend less later and therefore is a prudent place to spend our hard earned tax dollars. All spending must be examined in terms of long term savings. I certainly believe there are places where we can find strategic efficiencies within the state administration and we can always spend less on special sessions of the legislature by having a governor who is willing to do the work necessary to present a budget at the beginning of the session rather than in the final weeks.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support this set of reforms. As governor, I will work to implement our new red flag laws, which enable law enforcement to remove firearms from those deemed to be a danger to themselves of others. It is important that law enforcement is familiar with the law and has the processes in place for it to be properly utilized. Vermont saw more deaths from self-inflicted gunshot wounds from 2011-2016 than traffic accidents. I strongly support doing anything we can to curb this troubling issue. I will work with law enforcement and mental health agencies to improve the accuracy, quality, and accessibility to data and information regarding at risk individuals who should not be carrying or purchasing weapons.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","The top priority of my administration will be creating economic development that includes all Vermonters. We will get fiber optic cable to every home and business to enable all Vermonters to partake in the 21st century global economy. We will measure success based on the economic realities for the bottom 20percent of earners, rather than top income earners. Raising the minimum wage and investing in programs for displaced workers, focusing on job retraining for current and future job markets are two major parts of the solution. I will work to create Tax Increment Financing districts to increase the vibrancy of our downtown economies throughout the state. 
 
 
 
 My love for Vermont is deep and I know that the majority of Vermonters get up everyday and want to do their best - just like my coworkers at VEC.

On a U.S. Navy scholarship, James graduated from Villanova University. He spent the next four years in the Navy, commissioned as an officer including serving as a damage control officer on the USS Kidd, stationed in Panama. What once led James to serve his country overseas, next led him to settle in Vermont where he has continued to serve his community.

Nearly five percent of Vermonters under 65 do not have health insurance, and even having insurance does not necessarily mean access with deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. 
 
We must achieve universal health care, including vision and dental. Vermont has sought to advance a universal primary care bill as a first step. This is the right thing to do and will save us money in the long run through preventative care. Then we need to move toward universal health care, whether through Sen. Sanders' Medicare for All at the federal level or at the state level. 

We should expand investment in Vermont's Education Loan Repayment Program for health care professionals, which Gov. Scott tried to cut this year, and implement cost transparency measures as they've done in Maine.

Fixing health care is not only good for our health but the health of our school and municipal budgets. This also addresses our demographic concerns--retaining and attracting young families.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Despite challenges, our public school education system is among the best in the nation. We must continue to support our communities as they consolidate administrative costs in accordance with Act 46 instead of forcing changes on our neighborhoods. We must invest in our schools by ensuring every school has the funding it needs and increase teacher pay so they can retain and expand the workforce. We need affordable or free college for every single Vermonter so no one has to go into debt to get a degree and our young people can stay afloat in this economy. We must expand child care and pre-K by fully funding Vermont's child care Financial Assistance Program.
 
Nelson Mandela said, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" Investing in education will help us solve the big challenges of the future. We must continue to do so.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","As mentioned previously, we must invest in school, health care and our social programs. Every Vermont family should have access to child care and paid leave. This will attract people to Vermont to grow our tax base. 
 
I will invest in infrastructure and downtown revitalization to attract good, 21st-century jobs. Solid infrastructure is what attracts business more so than aNew York tax cuts or $10,000 gimmicks to bring in people from outside Vermont. That includes investing in water quality to support the health of our population as well as our economy – both in property values, tourism and recreation. 
 
Through all of this, corporations and the most affluent should pay their fair share to reduce growing inequality and invest in our people and planet.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"We should reduce spending on no-strings-attached corporate handouts provided through the VEGI program with little evidence to back up the impact of such programs on expanding employment that wouldn't otherwise be here. We should also stop Gov. Scott's push to pay down property taxes with one-time money, instead looking to invest in long-term programs. 

We should reduce the taxpayer subsidy of large corporate interests in fields that underpay workers in fields such as construction and retail. When people aren't given access to basic economic justice by their employers, the state ends up subsidizing their economic interests.
 
We have to increase spending on life's most basic necessity, clean water, which has been woefully neglected under the Scott administration. Vermont is mandated by the EPA to address the poisoning of our lake, but each administration kicks the can down the road. We have to invest in our climate commitments so we can achieve 90 percent renewables by 2030.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"People deserve to feel safe in their schools, homes and communities. S.221 was a great victory for those of us focused on domestic violence prevention and veteran care. S.55 continues to need work, as it did not provide for universal background checks as promised. It's essential we close the loopholes to ensure truly universal background checks for everyone; as governor, I would work to close these loopholes.
  
To truly promote school safety, we also need to invest in mental health and behavioral programs in schools. I share the concerns from our already overburdened law enforcement to enforce a magazine limit. Rather, we should consider an expanded background check system to ensure that no one has access to a gun that might take another life or their own.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","As governor, I will fight for justice for every Vermonter, both economic and environmental. Everyone deserves to live a dignified life, have equal opportunity and enjoy the wonders that our state has to offer. To address these deep problems, we need progressive tax reform and to raise the wage. 
 
Right now, we are moving away from economic and environmental justice. Rising inequality, attacks on unions and workers, neglect of our waterways and public infrastructure are hurting the Vermont we know and love. We must stand together, rise up, and say we've had enough. As your governor, I will invest in people and the planet to tackle the urgent problems before us. We can't wait any longer.",james-ehlers

Today, it's 76,000 –“ almost 30,000 fewer –“ and we're spending $1.6 billion. 
 
 
 
 This decline has created inefficiencies in our system that are eroding opportunities for kids. Every dollar we spend on overhead is a dollar that's not being spent on expanding opportunities and outcomes.
 
 
 
 I've called for reforms to improve efficiency, which will allow us to invest more in a cradle-to-career education system that's the best in the country, without raising the price tag on Vermonters. For instance, if we could increase the staff to student ratio, through natural attrition, from 4.25:1 to 5:1 (which would still be the lowest ratio in the country) we could save $100 million, which could be reinvested in early care and learning - benefiting our kids, our entire education system, and our workforce.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","The best way to help Vermonters is by building a more vibrant economy with more higher-paying jobs, giving people the tools to get those jobs, and letting them keep more of what they earn. I've made it a priority to invest in economic and workforce development initiatives in all 14 counties, not just the ones already doing well. And, we're seeing results. After a decade of a shrinking labor force, since the start of 2018, there are about 4,000 more workers in Vermont's workforce - but we need to grow further. We've also eliminated the income tax on Social Security benefits for low- and moderate- income Vermonters, ensuring they can keep more of what they earned. And, as I continue to push for education reform, I want to increase our investments in early care and learning, trades and technical education, and higher education, which too many families struggle to afford. By doing so, we can help provide children the opportunity to prepare for - and succeed in - school and the economy.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"When I took office my Administration developed a Growth Rate Calculation –“ a six-year rolling average of wage growth to ensure the state budget does not grow faster than wages or growth in the economy. And, in the two years I've been Governor, we have successfully kept budget growth below that average - allowing Vermonters to keep more of what they earn. But to be clear, we increased spending in State Government by more than $80M in FY2018 - without increasing aNew York taxes or fees in the General Fund, keeping the statewide residential property tax rate level for two years, and without reducing services to the most vulnerable.

Because if we're at a point where our kids are afraid to go to school, and parents are afraid to put them on a bus; or police don't have the tools they need to protect victims of violence; or families can't step in to prevent a loved one from taking their own life; then who are we? 
 
 
 
 If we hadn't even tried to reduce the possibility of a tragedy; if we didn't try to reduce suicide and the pain felt by the family left behind; or if we didn't try to prevent another death from domestic violence and another child growing up without a mother –“ I wouldn't be able to look my daughters and wife in the eyes and I wouldn't have done my job to try and protect all Vermonters.

This includes specific objectives, strategies for achieving them, and metrics for measuring progress. It ensures we're making progress towards our priorities. 
 
 
 
 A primary focus is to expand our workforce, which is key to each of our objectives: With more workers we have more people contributing to goods and services, and more revenue to invest in protecting the vulnerable and economic development. One way we've grown our labor force is by making Vermont more affordable, this helps to recruit and retain workers. We've made a lot of progress - from holding the line on taxes and fees, to saving Vermonters $30M by reducing income tax rates, to ensuring $71M in property tax rate relief, to investing in affordable housing.

No one should be forced to sell their home or lose their hard earned savings due to the roulette wheel of life. As a society, we all suffer when someone becomes less able to provide for themselves due to an illness or unpredictable event. We can have a system that protects all of us from this unpredictable reality. There are small countries that have universal health care systems that provide better outcomes and cost less than our system. 
 
I was proud to support and preside over the Senate as it passed legislation to provide significantly reduced drug prices by allowing prescription drug importation from Canada. But we have much farther to go. I support universal primary care here in our state, as well as Medicare For All. This would provide quality coverage for all Vermonters while saving money in the long run.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Over the years our schools have had to take on increasing responsibility for the social services that many children need. Currently many of those children are already receiving services through the Agency of Human Services, and others would be if they had greater access to them. There is an opportunity to both save money and improve outcomes by consolidating these services. Both Act 46 and the special education bill passed last year contain structural changes that will create massive savings, but they will take time.
 
The way to destroy public education is to mislead with sound bite rhetoric and artificially lower tax rates. It is well known and documented that this tax rate scheme will create a cliff in December when the projected tax rate increase will be artificially larger. Scaling that cliff will be difficult and will manufacture pressure to cut school programs. We have to look at the bigger system and understand how these political games will lead to unfortunate consequences.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Expanding internet and cell service, boosting wages and working conditions, improving our public education system and ensuring everyone in Vermont receives quality health care are all issues closely tied to helping low-income Vermonters succeed.
 
It's hard to build for the future when you're working two low wage jobs and worried endlessly about paying for health care. You're unlikely to start a small business if you don't have the chance to get a good education.
 
Some say our society cannot afford to do these things. The reality is we cannot afford not to do them. Not only would that be wrong, but our economy today is weakened because so many people with so much to offer are spinning their wheels just to keep their heads above water. And so they are kept from reaching their full potential. The industries that will revitalize our economy, create good paying jobs and expand our tax base to pay for our most vital needs will be built by the Vermonters we invest in and support today.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"It's easy to say spending should be decreased, but few will specify what they would actually cut because they know they would gore somebody's ox. That's the appeal of sound bite rhetoric: it sounds good, even if it is bad economic and social policy in the long run.
 
Reducing redundancy by combining some human service programs within our schools would alleviate some of our education spending challenges.
 
We would also see a significant boost in our economy – and therefore not need to raise tax rates – with a regulated and taxed cannabis system. The added economic activity is estimated to be in the range of $350 million, with tax revenues between $25 and $75 million from cannabis sales alone. There would be a further economic boost through the affiliated tourism industries. The reality is that the underground cannabis economy already exists, but is not paying its fair share. Taxing and regulating it is one significant way to expand state resources without further burdening working Vermonters.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I'm glad the governor is taking action to help keep our communities safe.

I believe we can protect these rights by keeping firearms out of the hands of those with known mental illnesses and those with a history of violence and abuse. I understand that there are some who are upset and feel their rights were taken away. But the reality is that those that are not a danger to society can still have access to the firearms they want.

Nearly all issues come down to an element of economic struggle whether the issue is crime, hatred toward others, family distress or other social challenges. When people cannot afford their basic needs, it is much harder to be sympathetic to others or stay concerned with the issues affecting our society as a whole, whether that is climate change, criminal justice reform, investing in paid family leave or simply having time to participate in our democracy.
 
Too many Vermonters in every part of our state are struggling economically, and our rural economy – like those across the country – has even greater challenges. Without investment in broadband, cell service, our agricultural economy and fixing our health care system, we will continue to have difficulty solving our shared challenges of water quality, climate change, social injustice and funding higher education.
 
 We must do more to build the middle class, not keep shrinking it.",david-zuckerman

But we have an opportunity to curb these increases through innovation and common-sense reforms. We must improve preventative care by incentivizing healthy lifestyles and fitness so that costs associated with unhealthy behaviors are reduced. We also need to take a hard look at tort reform and opening up health care to more competition in order to bring overall system costs down.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Vermonters have been crying out for real property tax relief and reform. We need to fundamentally re-examine our education system, starting with the way we pay for it. As an incentive, we need to allow for school districts to retain the savings from mergers and consolidations--rather than so much of it going back to the state. Additionally, by reforming property tax adjustments like income sensitivity, we can stabilize property tax rates and more closely align voters with the true impact of budgets. Finally, it is unfair for high-spending districts to hold responsible districts hostage by increasing the overall cost of the system. Districts that are spending well above the rate of inflation should require budget approval by at least 60 percent of the voters. Finally, I would require districts to establish measurable goals to improve student outcomes.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","The number one issue facing Vermonters is what it cost to live in our state. Whether it's the cost of child care, housing, utilities, higher education, health care, or taxes and fees, Vermonters are overburdened with an unsustainable and rising cost of living. Together, we must curb the rising cost of living that Vermonters are facing. That starts with regulatory and permit reform to make it easier to create new housing units. We need to help make higher education more accessible, we have to double-down on our efforts to make college and other forms of post-secondary education more affordable, while also partnering with our colleges and universities to ensure their financial health is sound. Most importantly our schools must be safe! We need to do more to ensure the safety of our children by increasing security.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"State spending should increase at a rate equivalent to the growth of the revenue stream supporting it. For far too long, state government has perpetually raised taxes and fees to cover unsustainable rates of spending. Thankfully, under Governor Scott, we've been able to begin to halt this trend, and passed the first budget without raising a single tax or fee. We must continue to hold the line on any additional taxes and fees. Already overburdened Vermonters cannot afford state government to charge them more.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I opposed passage of S.55 which requires universal background checks, established magazine capacity limits, raised the legal age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21 and bans the possession of bump stocks. I supported S.221 and H.422 as I feel they addressed firearm related issues in extreme risk instances and domestic assault situations. I do not support any additional measures to restrict Vermont gun owners rights.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Paid family leave will be one of my top priorities-Democrats and Republicans have debated paid family leave. Some of my colleagues point out that it will help Vermont families get ahead. Others have suggested it could increase costs. We have an opportunity to make paid family leave work for everyone by implementing a fully voluntary program. many employers already offer paid family leave, and many workers don't want paid leave. We shouldn't force them into paying for something they already have or aren't interested in. Instead, we can administer a paid leave program for those employers or workers who voluntarily chose to opt-in. This can become a competitive tool for recruiting workers--employers can chose to offer paid leave to all their employees as a means to recruit new workers. And those workers who really need paid leave can chose to pay into the system in exchange for it. New Hampshire and other states are considering this model, and California has implemented a similar program.",don-turner-jr

Many are concerned that easy voter registration process allows individuals who are not qualified to vote in Vermont are allowed to do so. An effective Voter ID system would resolve any doubts as to fraud and interference in the election process and can be designed and implemented to insure that every qualified individual is able to exercise their right to vote while preventing those who are not qualified from doing so. Cries of ""Voter Suppression"" are merely politically motivated scare tactics intended to rally the ill-informed - the greatest suppression issue is not the possibility of a qualified voter being denied their ""franchise,"" rather the disengagement by voters who believe the system is corrupted by fraud and that their vote will be altered, diluted by unqualified votes or not counted at all.",What changes or improvements would you seek to make in the state’s professional regulation?,"The Office of Professional Responsibility has a vast reach into every aspect of Vermont business and industry - despite repeated promises to make the licensing and regulation process easier to negotiate, the promised ""one stop shopping"" approach has failed to materialize and new automated processes have created new difficulties for many in the business sector.

The current voting process provides prompt reporting of results without compromising the accuracy and integrity of the vote. The integrity of Vermont's Election process is, to a large extent, related to our continued reliance on a the paper ballot which provides a ""hard copy"" back-up memorializing the voters intent - a security lacking in systems relying exclusively on ""touch screen"" technology. The current data collection of campaign financing information provides prompt reporting of information which is immediately available to the public.

When they were serving a Vermont's Secretary of State, both Jim Douglas and Deb Markowitz focused on developing educational materials for use by students and historians alike as part of the office's responsibility for overseeing the State Archives.

While we are constrained in many ways by federal law and policy, because it funds such a high percentage of our health care, we can be more aggressive in oversight of the ""accountable care organizations"" that are the new federally created bureaucratic layer working on payment reform. Our efforts at all-payer coordination are moving too slowly to make a difference for those just above Medicaid level, and we must make private insurers collaborate more. As vice-chair of the House Health Care Committee and author of our first ACO oversight bill, I will continue to push our agenda toward greater access and affordability.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Vermont has a strong education system, but an inequitable mechanism for sharing the costs. Taxpayers need to be able to ensure that their local budget decisions and investments affect their own property and income tax rates and that they are not burdened with the spending of high-cost districts. That isn't the case now, and one result of the lack of transparency can be voter disregard of the impact of budget increases.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Low income Vermonters pay a disproportionate amount of their income for housing, leaving them fewer options for getting ahead. Our housing investments last year were a step forward, but we need to do more to make affordable housing available and to build an economy that drives a healthy housing market. Strengthening the economy also generates more and better-paying jobs.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"There is very little that could be decreased without harming our quality of life and our commitment to those who need help in a crisis. We need to increase investments in health care and child protection, and to do so by growing our tax base to enable increases in spending that do not create the counter-effect of driving a higher tax burden. That's not to say, however, that there do not continue to be opportunities for savings through legislative oversight of the administration's budget.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support gun legislation that actually improves safety without being outweighed by burdens on people's rights. Most of the gun bills past this year actually did nothing productive to increase safety, but they penalized responsible owners, so I strongly opposed them. The only exception was giving the courts greater authority to remove firearms from people who were demonstrated to be a serious risk, and I supported those measures.

Upon graduation from the University of Vermont, Anthony entered the legal field and worked as a legal assistant in Burlington, Vermont, specializing in environmental law, from 2014-2015. Shifting gears, he began a career in digital marketing in 2015 at a digital marketing agency. Soon after, he landed his current position as a Senior Digital Advertising Strategist at Dealer.com.

It is more important than ever for our state legislature to codify the protections that are at risk of being removed by the federal government, and ensure all Vermonters have access to affordable health insurance and quality health care.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I believe we need to examine the continued consolidation of school districts to reduce the high cost of maintaining small schools within Vermont. One third of Vermont students in grades K-12 are still attending schools in non-unified districts. In addition, the consolidation of the teacher's health care contracts presents a meaningful step towards reducing the cost of contract negotiations by eliminating the need to negotiate at the local level. 
 
 At the beginning of the next legislative session, we will have the opportunity to regulate and tax the sale of marijuana, which became legal in July 2018. Colorado has successfully used revenue from the taxation of marijuana to build new schools and fund educational programs. Vermont needs to pass legislation to govern the retail marijuana market through regulation and taxation. It is disappointing that the legalization of marijuana moved forward without establishing conditions for a retail market that would generate revenue for the state.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Vermont relies on a large number of nonprofits to provide crucial services for the less privileged members of our communities. These nonprofits provide transportation, affordable housing, medical treatment and many other services to people who may otherwise not have access to or be able to afford these crucial programs. I believe we should establish a board to serve as a resource for the non-profits in Vermont. There is a large number of nonprofits that lack proper funding and suffer from staff shortages that could be aligned with larger nonprofits in order to more efficiently provide their services to their communities. This board would exist in a purely advisory capacity and assist nonprofits with grant applications, developing a regional alignment for nonprofits with similar missions and ensure the needs of the communities are being met.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I believe we need to increase funding for environmental cleanup and protection. Vermont needs to establish a long term source of funding for Lake Champlain in order to maintain a clean source of drinking water, provide a safe and enjoyable environment for recreation and protect the ecosystem. In addition, I believe we desperately need to increase funding for the treatment of opiate addiction and establish a more proactive outreach program for those struggling with addiction. This will help reduce the amount of money spent on prosecution and incarceration.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support the recent gun legislation signed into law by Gov.

Let's publicize existing debt forgiveness programs, and support our institutions of higher learning..With 350+ school districts in our state to serve 82,000 students, we spend a lot of money on overhead and administration. I introduced a bill to have a one school district for our state, so that we can maximize efficiencies like single teacher & transportation contracts, and make sure that all of our children are getting the education they need at reasonable costs Declining enrollment and small districts put substantial upward pressure on Vermont's per pupil expenditures, driving up property taxes and making Vermont less affordable. We can spend our educational dollars more wisely. Vermont has the smallest district size in the nation. It's an expensive top heavy system that spends way too much on overhead and administration. Let's ensure kids are getting the education they need to be successful.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","We need to make sure all Vermonters who are able and want to work are well trained and prepared for the jobs of the future. We need to help Vermonters overcome significant barriers to employment by insuring reliable transportation (including expanded public transportation, car share, and ride share options) as well as support for quality child care. It is important to attract and keep jobs in Vermont--especially jobs that take advantage of Vermont's unique character.
 Lack of education and poverty go hand in hand. Vermont's 10 percent statewide high school dropout rate isn't acceptable. We need to increase the number of Vermonters who get their high school diplomas. The typical high school graduate will: have employment and earnings as much as 50 -100 percent higher in lifetime income, and be less likely to draw on public money for assistance. Excellent public schools not only help children to learn, develop, and succeed, but they also help attract and keep businesses in Vermont.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"We must assure that how we spend our resources makes sense –“ that the costs are reasonable and the outcomes are effective. First we must look at what we are spending money on and how that is working. Where can we achieve efficiencies or redeploy resources. Let's make sure we are putting Vermont's financial resources to the best use. We need to look at the evidence about which programs do what we intend them to do and which do not. Let's make sure our spending is in line with our priorities and values. Vermont spends more on corrections than higher education. One school district could redeploy funds in education currently going to administrative costs, to early education,and improving educational outcomes for K-12. In corrections, we can effectively offer programs with better outcomes that lower recidivism and do not increase crime rates and save money. We must never use for profit prisons!

Since that time, I have served the courts as a Senior Judge at various times, most recently in October of 2015. I have a great deal of trial experience dealing with cases in the civil, criminal and family divisions of the Vermont Superior Court - including the court in Grand Isle County. As a North Hero Selectman and Moderator of both the Town Meeting and our School Board meeting, I am familiar with many of the issues that our county has to deal with such as taxation, school funding and renewable energy. I produce a cable television show in Burlington on Channel 17 that I have used to argue against the legalization of marijuana. Last year I arranged a Select Board meeting with the state legislators who represent North Hero. When that meeting was held, members of the Select Board and local attorneys told our guests that we had been suffering long delays in the disposition of cases. We explained that we were usually served by a Superior Court judge who came to us from Franklin County for just one day a week and that a single day per week was not enough. Lawyers often say that justice delayed is justice denied. One trial in Grand Isle County lasted for 2 years because the court could not schedule 2 consecutive days to hear the case. The 5 days of trial testimony were spread over 2 years. The delays that we are suffering have been caused by the failure of the legislature to appropriate enough money to provide the Vermont courts with an adequate number of judges, law clerks and support staff.

That is why I have supported the income sensitivity of our current system, and recent renewed efforts in the Vermont House to increase use of the progressive income tax to support public school funding.
 
Local school board members are working hard to maintain the quality of our educational system, while keeping increasing costs under control. I objected to the governor's last-minute proposals to impose classroom ratios across the state and his refusal to support the education taxes voted by local school boards.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Access to quality public education, from affordable quality child care and early education, through our public higher education system is essential to support all Vermonters, but particularly low-income Vermonters to move out of poverty and into sustainable jobs in our new economy. Well-paying jobs remain unfilled in Vermont for lack of trained work force members.
 
Vermont has one of the highest rates of high school graduation in the country, but one of the lowest rates of high school graduates going on to further professional training or higher education. We must continue to be innovative with efforts to encourage and guide an increasing number of our high school graduates to pursue further professional training or higher education, while providing the necessary supports for their success.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Vermont continues to be in the midst of a crisis in our public mental health system – a system which any one of us could suddenly need for ourselves, or the well-being of a neighbor or a family member. We must work to provide adequate staffing, training and salaries to the staff both in our community mental health and hospital settings.
 
Child care funding must be increased, as access to quality child care is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for working families. 
 
Public higher education in Vermont, specifically through the Vermont State Colleges System, requires additional public funding. Vermont is the second lowest of all states in our state support for public higher education. 84 percent of VSCS students are Vermonters. 49 percent of VSCS students are the first in their families to attend college. Rising tuition rates create barriers to accessing essential education and training, training which is essential to securing employment in our new economy.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted for and support all three common sense gun safety bills passed by the legislature and signed into law by Gov. Phil Scott. I do not believe that these gun safety bills undermine the protections of the Second Amendment, or the rights of Vermonters to responsibly own and use their personal firearms. 
 
Vermonters want to protect our children in schools, insure the safety of individuals in violent domestic relationships and keep guns out of the hands of those who have been determined to intend harm to themselves through suicide, or to others because of mental illness.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Affordable access to quality health care for all Vermonters will remain my priority issue if re-elected. Not only will I fight against the Trump administration's attacks on health care, I will continue our Vermont efforts to bring down the outrageous increases in prescription drug prices. With legislation we passed this session and with the enthusiastic support of our federal delegation, Vermont, a ""blue state,"" is working jointly with Utah, a ""red state,"" in a unique partnership. We are seeking authorization from Washington to demonstrate that importation of quality controlled, lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada can lower health care costs for citizens of Vermont and Utah. I will continue to pursue innovative approaches to lowering health care costs while maintaining quality of care.",bill-lippert

A large majority currently working in Vermont are planning on reducing their patients and/or retiring in the near future. The biggest impact will be on those Vermonters living in rural areas - causing difficulty in scheduling for needed appointments and increased travel times. We need to do more to recruit trained medical professionals to the area. Vermonters deserve the opportunity to receive health care.

Like a business with limited funds, Vermont needs to work to drive value for its residents with limits.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"Compromise is important to every debate. S.55 is a good example of compromise between two sides that provide some needed restriction while maintaining citizens constitutional rights. Most of S.55 is agreeable and should be implemented.

Limit on magazine size for example does nothing for the magazines already in circulation, questioning its initial need within Vermont.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My primary focus is to increase economic development within the state.

We need to attract and retain workers and families. We face a worker shortage for several reasons, and one of these is that parents who work need childcare. Many parents simply can not work because of the lack of regulated spaces in infant and toddler programs. Families feel harsh financial pressure. Vermont’s economy suffers.<br />Quality child care means state spending savings: fewer chronic health care outcomes, fewer children who will experience the achievement gap, more dollars in the hands of families to pay for necessities, less stress for families, and the ability for those living in poverty to have the chance to work.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted for the gun violence prevention legislation to improve safety in our schools and communities and to keep guns from those who are a danger to themselves and others-- not from responsible gun owners. <br />The new laws are law enforcement tools: research shows that in states with similar laws, gun deaths decrease by 40%. <br />New Law Summary: <br />~ Expand background checks;<br />~ Require long-gun purchasers to be 21 years or older (same age limit as for handguns) or to have passed a hunter safety course (veterans, law enforcement and military exempted);<br />~ Grandfather current ownership of high capacity magazines, but ban further transfer to reduce lethality of attacks when purchase of high capacity magazines intended for mass killings;<br />~Court may order temporary restriction on people's access to guns when they pose a danger to self or others, (“extreme risk protection” legislation);<br />~Law enforcement officers may remove firearms from the scene of domestic violence to protect victims & police.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","In the last biennium, my first term, I served on the Natural Resources, Fish and Wildlife Committee.

Instead of being motivated by additional fees for services and procedures, the pilot program aims to reward ACOs by the improvement in the health of their population and pays them on a per person basis. We need to give this program an opportunity to succeed before making any other large proposals.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Vermont's education system consistently ranks in the top 10 nationally for quality. But we can do better. Legislation in 2018 gives school districts more flexibility and reduces paperwork in the delivery of special education. This should improve outcomes for students with special needs and lower costs for the school districts. Once the scars have healed from the school district consolidation battles brought on by Act 46, the now larger school districts need to leverage their economies of scale to increase the quality of education for all students. In 3-5 years we can look at reducing the number of supervisory unions in the state to save additional overhead and have better aligned delivery of services. I believe that the kitchen table, not the halls of Montpelier, is the best place to decide where children should go to school. I support expanded school choice among public schools and schools like Burr & Burton that can meet all the requirements of a public school.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Rural Vermonters face greater economic obstacles than their urban counterparts: fewer types of jobs, scarce support services such as child care, inadequate internet and cell phone connectivity, lack of public transportation. The state needs to address those issues through a mix of policy and funding initiatives. Regardless of geography, many Vermonters lack the skills necessary to qualify for good paying jobs that exist already. We passed comprehensive workforce development legislation this year that aligns schools, career technical education centers, the Department of Labor and private industry to better prepare Vermonters for current and anticipated job openings. We also raised the Earned Income Tax Credit from 32 percent to 36 percent of the federal tax credit, putting more money in the pockets of low-income Vermonters.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"The FY2019 budget of $5.8 billion is just .5 percent higher than the previous budget. The state practices good fiscal discipline, even without a constitutional requirement to balance the budget. But the long term financial picture for Vermont is troubling because of an aging population and a large government apparatus which will require a gradual reduction in the size of state government to avoid tax increases that we cannot afford. The state must dedicate significant moneys to reduce the pollution of our waters. We must also invest in the expansion of hi-speed internet and cell phone coverage. To grow our economy, we must continually look at reducing the obstacles to doing business in Vermont. A growing economy and tax revenues will ease our financial pressures.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted for the four bills intended to reduce gun violence. They are incremental steps that provide for rational safety procedures while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners. The legislature also allocated $4 million to improve school building safety, which together with the new laws will help to reduce the threat of gun violence.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Education financing, water clean up and rural economic development. Education financing because of how much money we spend ($1.7 billion) and how we raise the money (statewide property tax, sales tax, lottery receipts, etc.). We need to contain and reduce our costs while offering property tax relief. Water clean up because the plan we have agreed to with the EPA is estimated to cost $2.3 billion over 20 years and we are funding just half of it with existing revenue sources. I want to be sure that the funding source that is created to fund it is closest to the actual pollution and polluters. Aside from the Burlington area, Vermont has not recovered from the recession of 2007-2008 and global urbanization continues to pull population from rural areas.

Uncertainty at the federal level are making things worse, if major changes are made at that level in Medicare and Medicaid the citizens of Vermont will suffer further. I have always supported universal health care for all Vermonters; I believe that single-payer health care system is a viable option in Vermont. many of my constituents agree. I get my heath care through the VA, which is a single payer model which works very well here in Vermont. Hopefully we will be able to initiate our prescription medication importation and distribution law that we passed this past year. Our older Vermonters need a break on the cost of their medication. They should not have to cut their pills in half, or take less then what is prescribed and risk their health due to an inability to pay for the medication they are prescribed.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","This past year there were a few new ideas floating around the Statehouse. I think we need to look at how we finance education rather then just focus on cost containment. I would not take cost reductions out of the picture, but when out citizens vote on their school budgets in March they are best able to decide what is best for their community. I thought implementing a income tax highbred to supplant out present income sensitivity system would work better. Some other discussions like moving some expenses from the education fund to the general fund, such as Act 46 school tax incentives, and Current Use among some others are worth further discussion. Cutting 4,000 Vermonters' jobs by uniformly changing student staff ratios is not a viable solution. I think it is time to pay more attention to funding our state colleges, before it's too late.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Our committee deals with homelessness and many issues facing low and moderate income Vermonters, but most gains have been made in urban areas. Lamoile Housing Partnership has had the most promising and innovative approach in affordable housing, but there are many rural counties that do not have such agencies that needs to change. We should consider public works projects to rebuild Vermont's infrastructure and put people to work. We need to bring Broad Ban Internet to the entire state, and improve transportation around the state. Transportation is the biggest barrier to raising families out of poverty. We have takes steps to correct some of the DMV rules which have made it more difficult to keep vehicles on the road without compromising our environment.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"While we need to keep our spending under control , some areas of the budget need attention. Using one time money for ongoing expenses is always a marginal budget move. Level funding for such things as our Opioid crisis amounts to a net loss for programs, many which need to expand to accommodate the needs of our communities and state. Some of the Governors budget cuts did not make sense, cutting millions for developmental disabled adults was a non starter for our committee. We thought it was an incredibly bad idea. The 2019 budget was lean at .5 percent growth, and an uptick in revenues, if continued will but the state back in a place where we might be able to do more. I look forward to those days to come.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted yes on all. With the information I had and my experience with up close and personal death by gunshot in my experiences as a combat solder in Vietnam I supported these measures. Like the governor, I likely would not have supported some of these bills, but after a close look at the Fair Haven incident I also was convinced it was time to look at some compromise measures which would not infringe our citizens rights under the Second Amendment. I think we did that, and I hope for the best. In matters such as this I think being proactive is the best approach.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I will continue my focus on the opioid epidemic as a priority. We need to address prevention and recovery with more resources and see that all of those who suffer from opioid substance disorder can access treatment and medication at the time when it is needed. We have made good progress, but we are not there yet. I have continued to focus on affordable child care, when I speak to young families they continue to tell me that one parent is working essentially to pay for child care for two children. We know that even with subsidies the profit margin and requirements for child care and Pre K centers are making it difficult to stay in business that needs to change. We need to continue to make progress in improving our mental health system patients should not be lingering in emergency rooms around the state waiting for a bet in a mental health facility. Some new ideas talked about this past session have promise.",chip-troiano

The legislature did some work regarding the high cost in the 2018 session, but more work still needs to be done. The increased need for mental health facilities to alleviate emergency departments would improve the quality and lower the cost of health care for Vermonters as well. The high utilization and access to opioids has led to the opioid epidemic with not enough resources to bring relief to those affected.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","In 2018, the Legislature addressed the need for reform within special education funding. Being part of the House Committee on Education, we spent a significant amount of time on this issue. As a result, H.897 was passed and Act 173 was enacted. Act 173 will provide greater flexibility for special education by moving away from a reimbursement model to a new census-based model. With this flexibility, there is more opportunity for efficiencies and potential savings of several million dollars while still providing high quality education. Also, the education finance system needs to be reformed. Currently, local voters are not tied closely enough to their spending habits. When local school budgets are voted on, the true impact to tax rates are not realized until all the state's school budgets have been approved. Reconnecting local school budgets to their communities by steepening the yield curve will more closely tie district tax rates to their spending.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I believe by expanding educational opportunities to low-income Vermonters, it will provide the tools necessary to earn a better living. Career and Technical Education (CTE) provided throughout Vermont can teach the skills and knowledge needed to earn a higher wage. By taking CTE courses during high school or returning to a career center in adulthood, the value of this education can lead to the success of the individual. I earned my degree from the University of Vermont to have the opportunity to work in finance at the the University of Vermont Medical Center. However, no college education was needed to obtain my real estate license. By taking an approved real estate course, passing the state and national exams, and finding a brokerage firm to work with, I was able to become a licensed real estate agent. This is just one illustration where a college degree is not the only path to earn a better living. Having access to and utilizing educational opportunities helps Vermonters thrive.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Overall, state spending needs to be contained in order to reduce taxes imposed on Vermonters. With a declining student enrollment and increasing costs, we have to curtail education spending. Also, any duplication of efforts by various areas of government should be reviewed and evaluate potential efficiencies between departments. We need to make sure we do not spend outside of our means and not just impose a new tax or fee to cover a shortfall.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted no to S.55 (Act 94) which now requires universal background checks, magazine capacity limits, raises the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21 and bans the possession of bump stocks. I voted yes to S.221 (Act 97) and H.422 (Act 92) as they addressed firearms in extreme risk cases to an individual or others and domestic assault situations.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My priority if elected would be to promote the need for affordable housing. As a real estate agent, I see firsthand the difficulty homebuyers have in finding a home. Affordable housing is the basis of economic development. In order to provide more and better jobs, the people and their families need a place to live. Affordable housing does not just entail the cost of the home, but the need to lower property taxes and create a higher level inventory of homes. Act 250 has created a long, complicated and expensive permitting process that is felt by the developer trying to provide housing and the end consumer, the future homeowner. By revamping Act 250, the permitting process can be redesigned to better facilitate residential and commercial development, while still keeping the beauty of Vermont intact. By creating a more business friendly environment with economic opportunity, Vermont can increase jobs and create more affordable housing to make it a more attractive place to live and work.",christopher-mattos

Massachusetts is three times as safe with 3.4 deaths per 100,000 versus 11.0 in Vermont. 
 
Recently, the gun lobby has taken a position that we should not even be LOOKING at anything related to guns but we look at a variety of bills every year, including gun laws. Certainly, NO one is trying to take guns away from law-abiding gun owners.

Education property taxes are higher than they otherwise would be because the state has systematically used the education fund for non-education purposes and for education costs other than pre-K through 12 education. I believe that this is wrong and a violation of Act 60. High property taxes threaten support for the quality education that Vermonters deserve. I believe that the state will be trying to impose the costs of child care and college on the education property tax, which will drive property taxes up even further. I support state support for both college attendance and child care for our young Vermonters, but such costs should be borne in the state general fund. I will fight for reform of the education finance system to protect education and property taxpayers.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","We need to provide more effective support for access to affordable housing, to support small businesses that create most of our jobs, and to provide worker training so that people have the necessary skills. Improvements in telecommunications systems in the rural areas are essential to facilitate business creation and expansion. The current system of renter and homeowner supports within the Education Fund paid for by the property tax should be converted to a housing income tax credit for low and middle income Vermonters. This could lead to lower property taxes, which would make housing more affordable, and people would not get more assistance if they have more expensive houses, which is what we have now. We should provide a voluntary paid family leave program to complement the new voluntary retirement program, as that could make low income jobs better. Developers should somehow be required to create more affordable units or renovate existing apartments when they build luxury units.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"We may need to spend more to invest in telecommunications coverage, to fulfill our pledge to clean up our lakes and rivers, and to provide drug addiction treatment to more Vermonters. But these increases can likely be funded through the natural growth of revenue with the growth of the economy. We should be putting more aside in the ""rainy day fund"" to prepare for the next recession. And we should generally be spending less through tax expenditures – these are tax provisions that allocate taxpayer dollars to certain activities or groups without the level of scrutiny and accountability that budget items have.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted for the gun bills. I supported the universal background check (except between family members), the restrictions of purchases by anyone under 21 who does not have gun safety training (gifts from family members are allowed), the bumpstock ban and the judicial procedures that would allow temporary confiscation of firearms from someone who is a danger to themselves or others. I did not think that the ban of the high capacity magazines was well designed or well thought out, so I opposed that section, but I voted for the bills. These bills do not guarantee community safety: we must continue to invest in school safety, mental health treatment, and domestic violence prevention. And ""see something, say something"" remains a powerful tool.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My priority will be to undertake further comprehensive tax reform. The income tax reform completed this past session was very good and shows what is possible. But the tax system remains riddled with contradictions that put provisions of the tax code at cross purposes with stated policy goals. The education finance system must be cleared of all costs that are not pre-K through 12 education. We must eliminate all hidden tax subsidies that support polluting activities or burning of fossil fuels. We must base any needed funding for the clean water fund on the principle that polluters pay. We must be as careful about allocating taxpayer dollars through the tax code as we are in allocating taxpayer dollars through the budget. Vermonters deserve a tax system that is simpler, more effective, and more equitable, and one of my highest priorities will be working for that goal.",cynthia-browning

The reduction in magazine size is unconstitutional. How can you justify it's okay for the police to have a 30 round magazine? Everyone should be afforded the same opportunity to protect themselves. Let's remember illegal drugs are against the law and people still use, sell and traffic them in Vermont. More people die every year with drugs than they do an AR15. Also, the AR15 wasn't even the weapon of choice in the situation that sparked this whole thing. No common sense was used and law-abiding citizens had their rights attacked.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?",I want to be work on cutting wasteful spending.

Pay for value, not volume of services provided. 
While doing this engage community partners to help address the social determinants of health to help reduce health care costs. Poverty drives health spending, focus together on addressing poverty and adverse childhood experiences.
 
Create economies of scale and combine public employees (state employees, teachers, municipal employees, state colleges, etc.) into a consolidated plan to help pay less on insurance and more on wellness and lower the administrative costs. Higher copays and deductibles are not the answer. Center everything around primary care and communtiy health teams.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I will work to make sure that all children enter school ready to learn. That requires a strong early child care system which recognizes that children cannot succeed unless families are strong. I will articulate how I will pay for that in one of the upcoming questions.
 
I support small schools and will do whatever I can to preserve our small school grants. If we lose our small schools we lose the heart of our communities. Rural economic development will be permanently damaged. Good luck trying to sell your family homes if your community does not have a school. Good luck attracting workers if there are no schools in rural Vermont. I think schools where teachers can truly connect with students, where principals can give everyone a ""high-five"" at the end of the day, are important and help make children feel valued.
 
As to cost containment, the special education and health insurance changes made in the last legislative session will help make the system more affordable.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Some 10,400 tax filiers in Vermont who earn in excess of $215,000 annually will receive and estimated $237 million in lower taxes as a result of the Trump tax cut. This windfall will run for the next 10 years and continue beyond that if Congress approves it. I support reducing that tax break by $37 million to increase what we pay child care providers to serve children from modest income families and to increase the Vermont Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This still leaves a $200 million windfall for these wealthy Vermonters. I do not believe they will leave their grandchildren or our beautiful state due to this change. The $37 million can increase the rate we pay child care providers from the current 2008 rates to 2017 levels and we can pay 100 percent of the cost for more modest income families. Finally, we can use some of the $37 million to increase the EITC for nearly 50,000 Vermonters and increase their average annual benefit from $600 to $1,000, without hurting their other benefits.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I do not support higher taxes on hard working Vermonters, though as I have said I will support more revenue from those at the higher income levels, within reason. As such I will continue, if re-elected and reappointed to the Appropriations Committee, to vote for budgets that hold the line on more taxes whenever possible. To do this I believe we need to consolidate the various government funded support agencies to achieve savings and efficiencies. I think we can explore collapsing the administrative overhead through greater consolidation. Can we keep locally responsive agencies working to help Vermonters but centralize the business office functions of those agencies to keep costs down? I think we have to try.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted to help keep Vermonters safe. These efforts will not solve the problem of violence we face, but they will help. I do support the Second Amendment and I understand as Tolstoy said, ""The real law lives in the kindness of our hearts. If our hearts are empty, no laws or government reforms can fill them."" Yet, we must do what we can to help keep children and our communities safe.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Climate change is hugely important. If we are smart in how we address it we can reduce our carbon footprint and re-engineer our economy at the same time to meet the demands that a clean environment requires. One area in particular I want to focus (beyond those already mentioned) is to use anticipated one-time funds to help make a massive effort to weatherize homes. This helps put money into the pockets of Vermonters, creates jobs and reduces pollution at the same time.
 
We will soon become the oldest state in America. The costs to treat people with dignity will be staggering. The workers to care for us will not be available and the expense too great to be shared by a small number of taxpayers. We need to start a plan to shift the balance from high cost health care to low cost home and community based care, and in so doing save money to achieve better results. A worker importation program coupled with a Medicare maximization effort will be key to success over the next 10-15 years.",david-yacovone

By funding medicare for all, we can remove significant overhead from our businesses, improve community health, lower administrative burdens on health care workers and put more money in Vermonters' pockets.
  
I believe that public goods and commons should be regulated as such. The costs of health care and other essential services are rising exponentially faster than our ability to pay, and the proceeds for these collective investments are not returning to the pockets of Vermonters. These projects should be structured with the needs of Vermonters first and profits second. Every one of us, regardless of income or birth, benefits from health care. We need to increase participation in our regulatory process and clarify accountability to make sure everyone's needs are served.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Communities require three services of schools: citizenship, training for the economy, and child care. In today's economy this means: 
 *Realigning our school funding to include the full spectrum of youth: birth–22.
 *Acknowledging that schools can and do serve as community centers, and they need to be resourced appropriately.
 *Creating a school funding formula that is equitable to those receiving funding, progressive to those funding it, and stable enough for long-term planning. 
 We need to look to the long term health of our communities and ensure that all of our students have equitable access to education regardless of location or income. We need to make our funding formulas transparent enough that communities feel investment in them and use our existing infrastructure and investment fully. Most importantly, we need to have community conversations about these issues so we can move beyond zero-sum equations and toward a state that puts children at the center of its communities' futures.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Vermonters need jobs that offer a stable living wage, paid family medical leave, and strong worker protections. When we live in a community where we (ourselves and our neighbors) can trust that our basic needs will be met, then we can make the next step together: towards vibrant streets, caring neighbors, and positive growth. While we work to strengthen our economy and grow wages, the eligibility process for our state benefits (housing, welfare, food stamps, medicaid, child care) needs to be integrated to lower the burden of paperwork on both the state and the citizen. As we design *how* people receive benefits, we must also align *when* people receive benefits to be sensitive to the needs of both working and nonworking families–”what we now call a –œbenefits cliff– must be a slow and steady –œoff ramp– that sets community members on their feet when they're ready, without risking family stability or inflicting moral judgment.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Taxes are a tool of social good, to fund our communities' joint needs–”they enable us to make decisions, deliberately and democratically, about the just distribution of resources. Vermonters set a vision for a state with comprehensive environmental laws, strong labor protections, a vibrant education and arts sector, and a robust social safety net including universal health care. This vision and policy framework require an administrative apparatus that is fully funded. Our public servants, including teachers and state employees, must be supported through adequate salaries and the tools they require to do their jobs well.
  
 I also think we've spent more than enough time trying to solve our telecom challenges through weak government incentives. It is time to recognize cell phone service and high-speed internet as the public good they are and dedicate state energy to the connection of every home.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I was proud of my state this session. When we talk about guns in Vermont, we often get into the same conversation about ""here and away"" or ""the way things were."" Sometimes we enter the national dialogue and talk about ""rights."" Rights and values don't stand alone, in isolation from each other; they often compete, vie for attention. The right to bear arms is one of these: it competes with many other people's – often more marginalized people's – right to safety. I think we all agree that we want to live in safe communities.
 
 Appropriate regulations will not hinder hunting. Regulations, including smaller magazines, comprehensive background checks, required trainings, and even licensing, will only serve to make it safer.
 
 We live in a community, in a country, that long ago appreciated that humans require some rules to keep people living in close proximity safe and secure. As with any issue, we must ask ourselves: who profits, and who is vulnerable? This issue is no different.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I will focus on building an environment where everyone can thrive. The majority of Vermonters are employed by small businesses, which need the right environment to grow and continue to employ more Vermonters. Family medical leave, a living wage, medicare for all, accessible child and elder care, and flexible and supportive work arrangements are necessary for people to participate in the economy and social networks. We know that growing up in poverty makes it more difficult for adults to maintain good health, graduate from high school, and make comfortable wages – and we also know that a community with strong social connections and a strong safety floor (meeting basic needs) leads to healthy adults and positive economic outcomes. Policies like subsidized child care and family medical leave, when used as part of wrap-around support for business and family, give youth, working adults, and elders, the health, flexibility, and time to contribute to their communities and economies.",emilie-kornheiser

That being said, I remain concerned with the direction our federal government has been going. We must protect those who have little voice in our system - the vulnerable and marginalized segments of our populations.

This has borne out statistically and anecdotally to be most cost effective as well as most efficient over all. It would appear that this has been bogged down artificially in our country because of the corporate interests on the other side of those who feign to represent us, and so for issues such as healthcare (where the majority seek one thing and the representatives legislate in a different way) we need to slowly, thoughtfully, and carefully start crafting mechanisms to thwart such, if I may borrow the term, malpractice. As long as those in this dialog continue to honor each other, lifting up the nurses, working with the pharmaceuticals, it appears that we're evolving fine in this direction, driving down prescription costs and seeking means to bring universal healthcare to all. as we must continue to move toward Universal single payer.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Seek an independent board of former educators and subject matter experts to access where improvements can be made and how, in dialog with school, college, and university boards, unions, and other stakeholders, not for or with, but as an investigative tool reporting to media and legislators. I am also very interested in capping tuition as an interim step toward free public secondary education. And student loan relief needs to stay in the conversation until we can find means to complete that experience for what is becoming a lost generation of the educated poor.
 As for declining populations, the Department, with unions, can address the ebb and flow of student teacher ratios. On one side are buy-outs, the other bonuses, incentives on both, etc. The dynamic must be honored to maintain quality.

Creative approaches may include such disparate yet viable considerations as rail, a smallish village constructing an atrium over it (making it an instant winter destination, especially for folks with seasonal affect disorder, owners of small dogs, etc. - this was floated a few decades back for Winooski (ultimately too big for what we had to work with) by the late genius Buckminster Fuller), and an agricultural study weighing what fruit trees can be planted where, adding food sources along bike paths etc., where for some reason there seem almost none anywhere.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"We need to find many more and much more balanced ways of funding besides basically hitting property taxes.

Educationally we need to ultimately make our public colleges and universities tuition free. In healthcare we see nursing cuts. Three hundred thousand-dollar homes are being touted as affordable housing (to whom are these affordable - not the working poor), we've lost two colleges in the last three years (BCC & NECI; a third if you count the Lyndon Johnson merger â€¦ and now Goddard is in financial trouble), and we're about to lose the Burlington skyline.

 The Federal system seemed to work(though minimally, as it was a start) when people were paying into a national pool. But, since the current administration has openly denied the U.S. working population of that health care pool, I am not sure how Vermont is going to pay for its own health care mandate using the same function, when any disgruntled Administration (state or federal) can come through and dismantle, and destroy the health care system on a whim. We have seen this can happen. Just watch what happened nationally, in 2017 and 2018.
 Vermont needs to switch to a one payer system.
 The Vermont health care mandate will work fine for those who have a better income but not for those of us who live paycheck-to-paycheck and have a low-paying job.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Vermont actually needs to fund higher education above and beyond what it does.

 College is not for everyone. Not every person needs to have a degree in order to be successful in life. That has always been a very grand tale of the educational system in our nation, and even in several parts of the planet. However, I think that it only fair that we supply some sort of trade school or certification system for students to have low cost to no-cost in higher education. We need to fund all of the higher.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I think that it is important that we set-up a system of required job training for those who are on state assistance, but he have the ability to actually work.

 For those who have mental and physical issues, who need to be on state assistance, this will help them out as it will take off people who do not need to be on state assistance for long periods of time. In other words the state system won't be overloaded, if we have a training (education) and work system on top of the temporary aid used to help people get back into the world of work, and self-sufficiency.

I believe in Universal Primary Care for Vermonters, and Americans alike. Practically, however, several members of the House Health Care Committee tell me it would be an unlikely prospect. I am optimistic nonetheless, as I would love to see our state and preferably our country, go in that direction.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I have always been a proponent of exploring a plausible transition from our current property-tax-based system for financing education, to an income-tax-based formula. It is important for the Legislature to seek out opportunities to simplify Vermont's education financing structure, so that voters, on Town Meeting Day, will actually be capable of understanding what their voting on. Local control is good, and we ought to protect that principle, but let's make sure Vermonters have a straightforward comprehension of how local budgets fit into the larger, statewide equation.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","With low-income tenants in mind specifically; I think the State should help landlords help renters bring their energy bills down by continuing to fund grant programs that connect low-income Vermonters with weatherization outfits and energy efficiency consultants. If landlords had a particularly attractive incentive to 'button up' the houses and apartments they rent out to low-income tenants, fuel bills would decrease in the wintertime. The same kind of incentive could apply to initiatives in renewable energy, like paneling roofs with solar. When fuel and energy bills decrease, the cost of living decreases.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I believe Vermont State Government should be investing in broadband access in the most rural areas of the state, so as to provide Vermonters the capacity to work from home. I think professionals of a motley variety would set up shop in Vermont, if they could perform their lucrative occupations remotely. I think we can all agree, people living in Vermont desire a more vibrant business presence, but modern day companies rely on a level of connectivity that Vermont hasn't yet been able to provide. 
 
 I've always wondered why agencies, departments, and state funded programs insist on spending every last penny of their corresponding budgets. The reason is, when it comes time to allocate state spending for the upcoming fiscal year, unspent monies are in jeopardy. The state should instead, incentivize fiscal prudence by offering bonus appropriations to the groups that display spending efficiency and/or savings as opposed to redistributing unspent funds because budgets weren't wholly depleted.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted for two of the three major pieces of gun legislation. I supported any aspect of gun legislation that would have a direct and deliberate impact on violent phenomena prompted by firearms. I voted in favor of H.422, a bill designed to protect domestic abuse victims from becoming homicide victims. I voted in favor of S.221, a bill designed to expand judges' jurisdiction as to warranted confiscation of guns from subjects deemed an 'extreme risk' to themselves and/or others. I voted against S.55, the largest gun bill, based on principles of representation. Striking a balance between my conscience and my constituency; I voted for two aspects of the bill, and against two, ultimately voting no on the overall package. The two parts I favored, were the ban on bump stocks and the age increase, because both provisions contribute directly to preventative policy. I voted against a magazine limit and against universal background checks, because both provisions are merely theoretical in nature.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","If I am to get re-elected to the House, I would be happy to remain on the Ag. & Forestry Committee, because I am really eager to figure out a viable solution to this state's water quality issues, as it is a problem that will take several decades to solve. I hope to work with other House Reps. and key Senators to build bridges between farmers and environmentalists to stimulate a productive and open dialogue without allowing animosity to obstruct accord. I really care about protecting agriculture in this state, as I think it is instrumental to our identity as a rustic state defined by neighborly culture. Farmers love to farm, that's why they do it. It's a hardly gainful lifestyle, and an important one. I want to see farmers to find friendship in the aid of clean water advocates, not the alarm of perceived discrimination. We need to change that conversation, so everybody is coming co-operatively to the same table. With some ingenuity, we will solve this problem collaboratively!",jay-hooper

Now retired from the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) at the rank of Captain (O-6), I served for 15 years as a Branch Chief at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, part of the National Institutes of Health.
 
 
 
 Previously, I was a contracted veterinarian for the National Cancer Institute. I served in both the Air Force and Army, stationed at Incirlik Air base (NATO) in Turkey and at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
 
 
 
 I currently serve in the Vermont House of Representatives. I am the ranking member of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry.

 I also currently serve on the Board of Trustees for the University of Vermont.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","It is imperative that we act to protect Vermonters from changes made to the Federal Affordable Care Act to insure continued health care coverage. Affordable health care is a necessity. 
 
 
 
 The Vermont legislature must continue to explore options for health care reform. many in the legislature have not given up on a health care system that will provide health care for every Vermonter. Exploring health care options with other northeastern states may provide the most logical path forward to making this a reality.
 
 
 
 My experience in the Public Health Service and as a veterinarian has underscored my belief in the importance of preventive medicine. We need to make strides in limiting health care expenses by reducing unnecessary tests and procedures, and by controlling bureaucracy and unnecessary paperwork. 
 
 
 
  I am committed to making improvements to our health care system so that every Vermonter, without regard to employment, has access to health care and prescription medications.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I agree that the issue of fairness and equality should remain central to the discussion about educational opportunity and funding. Education in Vermont has a complicated funding structure that I am optimistic can be simplified. However, the principal of equal opportunity must be protected.
 
 
 
 Vermont does a great job graduating high school students, but ranks rather low in graduating the same students from college or other programs. Financial barriers and lack of preparation should not be the driving factors in a student's decision not to pursue a post secondary education. We need to lower the costs associated with a college education.
 
 
 
 Maintaining quality education in Vermont is essential. Education is the key to providing for the future of our children. A well-educated populace strengthens our communities and our economy. Seeing that our children have opportunities to excel is high on my priority list.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?",I will sponsor and work again to pass bills that will increase the minimum wage and provide for paid family leave for Vermonters. I was among those who were extremely disappointed by the Governor's veto of these bills. I have been an active members of the Workers' Caucus for my entire tenure in the legislature. We need incentives to attract businesses to Vermont in order to provide employment and fulfilling careers. And we also need to insure that there are training programs so that Vermonters are adequately trained to fill those jobs. We need to do more work on options for affordable housing. We need to insure the continuation of effective programs designed to protect the most vulnerable Vermonters.,Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"After serval years of of decreased state tax revenue, numerous cuts have already been made to many important programs. It has been a yearly challenge to identify spending reductions without adversely affecting vulnerable Vermonters. Each House committee has worked to ensure that all state agencies are run efficiently and that all funded programs are accomplishing their goals. This must be an ongoing effort.
 
 
 
  We must continue to maintain a balanced budget. We have a AAA bond rating because of our strong fiscal policies. The rating reflects Vermont's strong financial management. Our debt is modest and our economy, while small for a state, is vibrant.
 
 
 
 There are a few areas I believe require increased funding. These include:
 
 - energy efficiency and weatherization programs
 
 - drug abuse programs
 
 - renewable energy
 
 - higher education
 
 - programs to protect the most vulnerable Vermonters
 
 - programs to address water quality issues in Lake Champlain and other waterways across the state.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"Vermont is not immune to the threats and violence that have shaken communities across the nation. I was pleased that we could pass sensible gun safety legislation that is widely supported by Vermonters. I talked to as many constituents as I could in order to understand their views and concerns associated with gun safety and violence issues in Vermont. We should have the freedom to be safe in our homes, neighborhoods, schools, and at work without the threat of gun violence hanging over our heads. 
 
 
 
 I believe several aspects of the new law are particularly important: extreme risk protection orders, removal of firearms from the scene of volatile domestic assault situations, condition of pre-trial release, and universal background checks.
 
 
 
 This was accomplished without infringing on the Constitutional rights of Vermonters. No action was taken that prevents law abiding citizens from being able to own, purchase, or sell guns.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Vermont's energy future is one of my paramount concerns. Availability of affordable energy is important to our quality of life and has far-reaching implications for the economy of our state. We need to reduce our reliance on non-renewable sources of energy. global climate change could have disastrous effects on the economy (e.g., ski industry, farming, and maple sugaring).
 
 
 
 Vermont needs a comprehensive and viable long-range energy plan. Since there currently is no single energy panacea, this plan must be multi-faceted. We need to:
 
 - create incentives for energy conservation and efficiency
 
 - reduce our total greenhouse gas emissions
 
 - yield more of our electric power from renewable sources including wind, solar, hydro, and biomass
 
 - support the deployment of small renewable energy projects
 
 - help farmers diversify by producing electricity from farm waste
 
 
 
 Vermont has the opportunity to become a leader in renewable technology and to create well-paying jobs in the process.",john-bartholomew

 My background includes working at state departments of education and commerce, and at a small business. I currently serve as the Director of the Financial Futures Program at the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity. These experiences have exposed me to the complicated and interrelated nature of our educational and economic systems, and the vital importance of small business in creating a thriving Main Street.
 
 
 
 My volunteer service includes Peace Corps, AmeriCorps*VISTA, and being a Court Appointed Special Advocate for children in the foster care system.

I've spoken to too many of my neighbors who have had to choose between tending to their health or paying their rent. We need to ensure that every Vermonter has access to care and coverage for the prevention, treatment, and medication they need to be active members of our communities and our economy.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","We have a lot to be proud of when it comes to our education system in Vermont. This is a direct result of our investments into education as a public good that benefits not just our students and communities, but our state's economic future as a whole. In the biennium ahead we need to look at ways to continue our investments while taking into account people's ability to pay. A shift from property tax to income tax would make Vermont more affordable for many, while continuing to ensure high quality education. We also need to continue our investments in early childhood and post-secondary education – these will pay dividends well into our future, ensure young Vermonters can stay and raise families here, and attract more families to move into our state.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","We live in one of the richest countries in the world. And yet too many Vermonters are struggling. This isn't due to poor choices. It's due to poor policies. I will work to create an opportunity economy in which all Vermonters can thrive, regardless of their zip code. A few of the ways we can get there include working on ways to overcome benefits cliffs, gradually increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, creating a paid family and medical leave insurance program, and ensuring access to affordable, high quality child care. We should also look to our current successes and expand policies with proven poverty alleviation track records (such as earned income tax credits, workforce development and training programs, and support for small businesses).",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Budgeting should start with a vision of where we want to go as a state, current needs, and outcomes we want to achieve. Spending, then, becomes a plan of how we will get there. This includes looking at our general fund spending as well as the dollars we spend each year through our tax code. At the end of the day, we need to be accountable to the people of Vermont and the day-to-day issues that impact them the most. The top issues I am hearing from my neighbors include education, child care, health care, ending the opiate epidemic, clean water, and reducing the cost of living in our state.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,I am in support of them.,"What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Many of us are only one new family member, unexpected medical incident, or ailing parent away from economic tailspin.

 B.A. 1986 (political science)
 
 MSJ with highest honors 1990 (journalism)","Kathleen James is a nonprofit manager in Manchester, where she has lived for 22 years. She's executive director of the International Skiing History Association and editor of ISHA's journal, Skiing History.
 
 Raised in Nebraska, Kathleen earned a Bachelor's degree in political science and a master's in journalism from Northwestern University. She worked as a Capitol Hill reporter for Roll Call, a reporter-researcher for TIME, and a senior editor for Snow Country before settling in the Northshire. She has since worked as admissions director at Southern Vermont College, editor-in-chief of Vermont Magazine, and communications director at The BOMA Project.
 
 Kathleen has served on the boards of Manchester Elementary Middle School, Friends of MEMS, Manchester School Fund and Zion Preschool. She is chair of the Manchester Democrats and a 2018 graduate of Emerge Vermont. Her wife, Alexandra Heintz, is a health care administrator; her daughters, both Burr and Burton graduates, are 22 and 19.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kath-James.jpg,Yes,Decline to answer,Yes,Yes,No,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","I'm in favor of working toward universal coverage. The legislature is currently studying universal primary care–how the program would work, and how it would be funded. I am interested to see whether this plan could provide a reasonable first step toward improving the health of all Vermonters by providing access to regular preventive care, reducing the need for costly interventions and emergency room visits later. I'm also a strong proponent of tackling the opioid crisis by investing in harm reduction strategies, expanded access to treatment on demand, and long-term recovery support. Addiction is not a crime or a moral failing; it is a disease.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I'm one of many people who moved to the Northshire for its unique and outstanding education system–”my daughters went to public school (MEMS) and then attended Burr and Burton Academy. So I support school choice as it's implemented here in Vermont –”it provides opportunity for students of all income levels while drawing families to raise their kids here. 
 
 
 
 I also support expanding access for all Vermonters to early ed, higher ed, and tech ed. The ""climate economy"" provides a wide range of good-paying, family-supporting jobs in the skilled trades–”retrofitting buildings, installing solar panels and much more. It also attracts tech entrepreneurs and innovative start-ups. I'd like to see us invest in these training programs as a way to keep young people in Vermont and attract new residents.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I'm enthusiastic about the work that the Vermont Rural Development Council is doing around its Climate Economy Initiative, with its goal of making Vermont a national destination for climate-change entrepreneurs. This presents an exciting opportunity for new, good-paying jobs that support families. 
 
 
 
 In the meantime, I believe that low-income Vermonters would benefit from universal primary care, paid family leave and expanded access to broadband, transportation and affordable housing. (I am still studying the $15 minimum wage. While I would be inclined to support it, if phased in incrementally over time, I am concerned about the potential impact on small businesses.) 
 
 
 
 I'm also interested in the –œtiNY house– movement that provides small homes for low-income residents; the homes are not only affordable but energy efficient, which saves on heating bills while helping Vermont move toward its goal of 90 percent renewable energy by 2050.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I'm self-employed and work at a small nonprofit, so I understand the pain of paying taxes. When it comes to property taxes, I am optimistic that we will start to see some savings as districts consolidate through Act 46. At the same time, I also believe we need to invest in the programs and services that serve and support Vermont families.
 
 
 
 I support the efforts to find a fair and responsible way to fund the protection and clean-up of our lakes and waterways. It's a critical investment in the health of residents and in our ecosystem, not to mention the important economic sectors of outdoor recreation and tourism. It has to happen, and it will only be more expensive if we keep kicking the can down the road.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I grew up in a gun-owning home and I strongly support the right of Vermonters to own guns for hunting, sporting and self-defense. But I also believe that we can and should take common-sense, reasonable steps to prevent gun violence, and that we can accomplish this without undermining the original intent of the Second Amendment. I would have supported the package of gun-violence prevention bills that passed the legislature this year.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Our future lies in promoting a dynamic, diverse –œgreen– economy. Vermont can and should lead the nation in tackling climate change while building the economy of the future. We need workforce training and new business opportunities in climate adaptation and mitigation, renewable energy, clean transportation, food and agriculture, tourism and outdoor recreation, small business, high tech and the arts. If we are proactive and creative about dealing with climate change, we can create new jobs, attract new residents, and provide more options for young people to stay in Vermont and build a life here.
 
 
 
 Policy aside, I would make constituent communication a top priority. Residents deserve to know where I stand -- and how I'm voting – in Montpelier. If elected, I commit to holding regular constituent meetings and office hours across our district, sending an online newsletter to anyone interested in receiving it, and publishing regular updates on social media and in the local papers.",kathleen-james

I think too often we expect Washington to solve this problem for us but Washington is too chaotic to rely on for something this important. As we have seen recently, even if one administration does change things, nothing stops the next administration from throwing it away. This is literally a matter of life and death; we can't wait for Washington to fix it. Going to the doctor should not bankrupt you and statistically we have worse outcomes at higher costs. I did like the All-Payer system proposal, but while we figure out how to explore such a system people are still going broke because they get sick. So my approach will be to transition gradually to Medicare-for-all while we figure out how the All-Payer Care would even work.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","We need a new approach to funding education. We need to get back to what made our education system great and not force schools into ineffective consolidations.

Property tax as a funding source is ineffective at the state level and harms more than it helps. I always support looking creative solutions in other states because this is not a problem we only have here.
 We need to invest more money training Vermonters for the jobs that are here.

Low-income Vermonters across the state should have easier access to good health care and advanced/technical education. We currently have a demand for higher-skilled labor in Vermont that only requires technical certification or a 2-year degree. We should help low-income Vermonters access these programs or start state-funded programs as an investment in our economy.,Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,The other questions contain more context about where I think we need to increase and decrease spending at the State level.,Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"As a whole I support the gun bills. I think they mostly made sense and do not over-regulate our right to continue owning guns. While I do think they addressed problems we largely don't have in Vermont, I also think we need to think about our neighbors and how the ease of access to guns in Vermont effects our greater region.
 That being said guns and gun legislation are not on my list as far as issues going forward. I want to see how these laws are enforced and do/don't work before passing new legislation or repealing these laws.
 And I think either way we have far more important issues to spend our time on than guns. Most gun deaths in Vermont are suicides and given that I think we should 
 I think we should spend more time worrying about access to proper mental health care given that most gun deaths in Vermont are suicide.
 I also think given the imminent rise of 3-D printing technology gun regulation itself may become frivolous soon, and we need to be prepared for that possibility.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My priority in Montpelier is to fix our drug policy. Prohibition has failed to have any meaningful impact on drug use and costs millions of dollars every year. By decriminalizing possession for small amounts of all drugs similar to what we have done with marijuana we can stop incarcerating people for largely victim-less crimes. We spend $50,000/inmate per year, and I think that money would be significantly more effective in treatment programs. This type of approach has proven to be dramatically more effective our current system. many currently illegal drugs have also shown to be very effective at treating other major health crises, so I also see this as an avenue for encouraging a new ""industry"" in Vermont by making it easier to research these potential treatments.

This has potential to save money for Vermonters because it encourages patients to receive consistent primary care and can prevent standard medical problems from becoming serious. It also ensures that every Vermonter has coverage for basic medical services.
 
 I am concerned about the direction the state is going with the Accountability Care Organization (ACO) system. The role of an ACO is to receive federal, state, and insurance money and to distribute it to health care providers. In theory, there would be many ACOs in the state of Vermont. In practice, there is only one - OneCare Vermont - which is run by the University of Vermont Medical Center and represents a monopoly on a 2018 budget of $620 million. This small group wields an incredible amount of power, and it is not clear that ACO system will result in any savings.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","As a graduate of Waterville Elementary School, Lamoille Union High School, and the University of Vermont, I believe that Vermont's public education system can provide some of the highest-quality social and academic resources in the country. Keeping schools under local control allows schools to tailor their programs to meet the specific needs of each community, and I particularly believe that small schools serve a special role in small communities. There are a few programs, like private school vouchers for students from ""choice"" towns, that only truly provide opportunities for students with greater resources. Rather than support programs like these, we should continue to believe in our public education system and look for ways to further integrate schools and communities.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","In rural areas, job creation is crucial for low-income Vermonters. This means that we need legislation to lower the burden on small businesses. I also hope to ensure that public transportation is readily available for rural people. In addition, I support universal primary care to help both rural and urban low-income Vermonters meet their basic health care needs, and I believe that we can keep working toward increasing access to nutritious food in Vermont.
 
 I support fair wages for all employees, and I will particularly fight for increased wages at organizations with high-salary CEOs, such as the UVMMC. However, I am worried that a state-wide $15/hr minimum wage places a disproportionate burden on small, rural businesses, and thus reduces job opportunities in small towns.
 
 I have personally seen the high property tax rates in Vermont harm community members and businesses whose property taxes are greater than their incomes can support. I would like to see legislation reflect this awareness.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,,Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"Protecting gun rights for responsible gun owners goes hand in hand with keeping guns away from individuals with violent intentions. As our governor has stated, the planned mass shooting at Fair Haven High School indicates that ""Vermont is not immune"" to extreme gun violence. When my father bought a new gun recently, the background check took only five minutes, and I am willing to accept that small inconvenience as an important aspect of preventing gun violence. I support the recent laws that expand existing background check requirements to include private sales, as well as those that allow law enforcement officials to remove a gun from the scene of a domestic assault. I believe in upholding second amendment rights for responsible gun owners while enacting legislation that saves lives.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My priority issues are restructuring Vermont's health care system, as described above, and keeping control of schools local.

I would listen to those who are expert on the topic. I firmly believe, however, that affordable, quality health care (mental and physical) should be easily accessible for all Vermonters. Facets of the Affordable Care Act need to be protected at the state level... for instance, coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions and the like. Decent housing for all Vermonters is integral to improved health care. Housing is like a vaccine against all sorts of illness. Another ""vaccine"" is teams of professionals working with patients on illness prevention, follow-up after illness, et cetera.

We should support it, not whittle away at it. All the money in the Education Fund should be available for distribution as state aid, this also supporting lower property taxes. The Education Fund is not a ""sugar bowl"" to be used in any other way. An initiative such as instituting a mandatory teacher-student ratio is not a move to strengthen our schools; it is a way to cut funding, which translates into cutting support systems desperately needed by today's young people. A visit to virtually any local classroom will demonstrate that this is not hyperbole. Appointees to the State Board of Education should be proponents of public education, and the Secretary of Education should absolutely have an education background.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Wages should be such that people do not need to work two or three jobs to just get by... raise the minimum wage. We need to further blunt the effect of the ""benefit cliff."" We need to adequately fund programs such as child care financial assistance, OEO economic development opportunities, low-income weatherization, LIHEAP. We could/should consider a per night occupancy fee in our hotels and inns to generate money to support affordable (truly affordable) housing and initiatives to decrease homelessness, as examples.

Dismantling the Affordable Care Act has only driven prices up.
 
 More emphasis needs to be placed on providing treatment for drug addiction and mental illness, and providing housing for our seniors and those who are vulnerable. 
 
 Changes are already taking place in our health care system. Providers are focusing on results rather than being paid for procedures or tests and more focus is being placed on preventative measures. This will provide better health care for patients and save us money.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","It is time we rethink how we fund our schools. The Legislature started this work this past session and it will continue it into the next. More and more demands are placed on our schools, with more children suffering from adverse childhood experiences such as addicted family members and poverty. We need to find ways to fund our education system that are fair and have local accountability. Too often people forget that voting for an increase in their local school budget equates to an increase in their taxes.
 
 We are taking a closer look at our special education system to find ways to make it more efficient while still providing quality education.
 
 Access to good, affordable child care is essential. I would like to see pre-K and summer programs for kids expanded.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Gradually increasing the minimum wage would do much to help low-income Vermonters. Gradually increasing the wage is something small business owners can work with, and the small business owners I talked with support livable wages. If we are going to close the gap between the very rich and the very poor, policies need to be put in place to help bolster the incomes of those struggling to survive. People want to care for their families without taking handouts and a livable wage allows them to do so with dignity.
 
 Affordable housing is a huge issue in Vermont. We need to put more resources into housing with the thought that we can not attract young people to our state nor can we ensure comfortable places to live for our seniors, if we don't have affordable housing.
 
 And, we need to close the gender gap for women, who are often the head of their households. Making sure they are paid the same as men will go far in helping single mom families.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"It's important that the legislature carefully review all spending, deciding where dollars are most needed and looking for those opportunities where spending a little now will save much more in the future. We are looking at efficiencies in education, one of the main cost drivers in our State budget. And we are constantly seeking better ways to provide health care, not only by saving money but in providing better services and creating a healthier public.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support measures that protect all people, especially children, from gun violence. What has been happening across the U.S. and Vermont is horrific. We know stronger gun laws work. I believe support for the 2nd amendment goes hand-in-hand with keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I have several priorities. Equal pay for women is huge for me. As a woman in the workplace for over 40 years, I have witnessed first hand the discrepancy between what men and women are paid. Sometimes it is not apparent and is disguised by different job titles. Closing the gender gap would go far in helping families who are struggling to make ends meet.
 
 If elected, I will continue my work on strengthening Vermont's energy efficiency standards. I was a lead sponsor of H.410 and H.411, which save Vermonters electricity and money on home appliances. Both were signed into law. I support legislation that strengthens and expands minimum energy standards and guarantees that all appliances Vermonters buy are energy efficient.
 
 Finally, so much hinges on livable wages - pulling people out of poverty, allowing people to care for their families with dignity, creating jobs, making sure children don't suffer food insecurity. This will be a priority for me.",marcia-lawrence-gardner

The current federal administration has destabilized our existing system so severely that the cost of insurance is skyrocketing, making coverage out of reach for an increasing number of Vermonters. We must have a health care system that is financed publicly with strong transparent government regulation that allows for ample public engagement. I will fight for laws protecting the public from the impact of health care and pharmaceutical corporate greed, and support steps such as Universal Primary Care that move us toward a sane health care system.
 
 Addiction is a public health crisis that touches all of our communities. Vermonters struggling with addiction are suffering from a disease. I will work to expand access to health care services instead of expending resources on mandatory minimums for nonviolent crimes.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Investing in schools is investing in the heart of our communities. With a progressive tax system that ensures corporations and wealthy are paying their fair share, we can reduce the tax burden related to education for many Vermonters while providing the needed funding for healthy and vibrant school environments. I will support the continued progress legislators have made in this direction.
 
 College students should not graduate in debt. Since the 1980s, Vermont has continued to dis-invest in higher education. Our state ranks 49th in the nation for state fiscal support for education and training after high school. We must invest in our public higher education system and reduce excessive administrative cost.
 
 Early childhood education is critical to helping our children get off to a great start and ensure that they succeed later in life. I will work with front line professionals to improve access to ECE, as well as access to day care.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I will address growing income and wealth inequality, fight for a livable wage, the right to organize and bargain collectively in the workplace, support efforts to dramatically improve access to affordable housing, and ensure all have access to education and training to grow thrive in a just economic system.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I object to how you asked the question about Gov.

I believe that we do have the resources to pay for the public goods and services that our kids, elders, ALL of us deserve, keep our environment clean and prepare now for the urgent issue of climate change. I am interested in shifting how/where we raise revenue so that it is just and fair. I can say that I support less investment in for profit prisons, I support addressing over-incarceration and the social constructs that contribute to it, and increase investment in health care, education (ECE to higher ed), the environment and addressing climate change (which includes transportation infrastructure).",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support expanding background checks.

 I support banning bump stocks.
 
 I question the enforceability of the ban on high capacity magazines, and whether it is possible to define them specifically enough to be able to legislate about them fairly and effectively. I need to have more discussion about this issue, including with gun owners.

It was not something a 20-something even inquired about upon taking a job because it was included as part of the benefits package for most every position available. Today, health care costs are spiraling out of control, not only in Vermont but nationwide. In one of the most developed countries in the world, health care should be a basic human right that every person can count upon. In Vermont, we must work to shore up our health care system so that the national dismantling effort underway does not compromise coverage for Vermonters, including the most vulnerable and those with pre-existing conditions.
 
 Deeper incentives can be created in the areas of prevention and education, and it needs to start earlier in families and schools. Unless we get ahead of the curve in terms of diet, healthy behaviors and exercise, health care costs will consume more of our state expenditures, which we cannot afford.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","My son has attended Vermont public schools since the 3rd grade; he is now a rising sophomore. I am pleased with the education he has received, focused on problem-solving and critical thinking.
 
 While Vermont has one of the highest high school graduation rates in the country, we do not fare nearly as well in terms of the percentage of students moving on to post-secondary education or training, which we know is essential to an individual's economic well-being and the economic success of our state. We need to improve practical preparation, as well as the pipeline from middle/high school to colleges, post-secondary training and technical schools, and make those linkages well before the 12th grade. There are well-paying jobs in the advanced manufacturing sector, in welding, in plumbing and electrical, which go unfilled in our state because we are not preparing our young people adequately for these fields, nor creating pipelines that funnel high-school graduates into these careers.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I am well-aware of the myriad challenges faced by low-income Vermonters because of my work with incarcerated women at the Northwest and Chittenden Correctional Facilities, as well as at nonprofit organization, Vermont Works for Women in Winooski. In addition, my own family (over 15 years) has accompanied a single mother with five young children who came as refugees through the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program. There are frankly no simplistic answers re: how to help them, as well as to ensure their economic success. No less than a comprehensive approach is required that includes livable-wage employment; affordable housing and day care; quality education; health care coverage; and adequate transportation, especially within rural communities. My experience has shown me that relationship-based navigators who can help/advise/support severely challenged low-income Vermonters (dealing with numerous co-occurring stressors) is an extremely effective model with progress and results over time.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I would be in favor of increased spending for (subsidized) child care in Vermont due to the incredible shortage of high-quality, affordable daycare for the children of women/men who want to be employed, but drop out of the workforce because they are not satisfied with the scattershot, low-quality care available. These decisions to stay home detract from the accumulation of personal incomes over time; their opportunities to move ahead in their careers or start businesses; their Social Security incomes contributed to; as well as contributions to the overall state tax base.
 
 In terms of decreases in spending, I believe there are significant reforms we can make to the criminal justice system in the areas of incarceration and sentencing, which will result in lower costs for taxpayers and better outcomes in reducing recidivism.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support all three gun-safety bills signed by Gov. Phil Scott, and I commend legislators and advocates for working to craft them over many weeks, months and years.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","It is challenging to have one priority issue in Vermont, as so many issue-areas are intersectional and inextricably bound. I think of the triad issues of incarceration, addiction and mental illness, which are nearly impossible to address singularly, but must be looked at collectively as impinging one upon the other. I think of the hundreds of incarcerated women I worked with over five years who have suffered severe childhood traumas and resultant mental illness; medicated themselves and became addicts; went on to commit crimes to gain money to feed their drug habits; only to end up behind bars - ultimately because of trauma never addressed. 
 
 I believe that these human and societal challenges will be addressed only when we look at issue-areas in holistic ways and employ creative strategies across related government agencies to leverage strengths and evidence-based solutions.",marybeth-redmond

By imposing a fee on those who are not covered, I believe we are taking away their freedom of choice. We need to first look at the cost of prescription medications, which is hurting our seniors as well as others who are on fixed incomes. Vermonters are being charged hundreds of dollars for pills that literally cost a few cents to make.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I don't believe cutting the number of educators per school is the answer. Special education is federally mandated and cannot be cut. Tenured teachers are also protected. This leaves new graduates in the field of education to be cut. These new graduates will leave our state to seek employment elsewhere. I believe the key to better education lies in the curriculum being taught, and comprehensive goals developed by educators from around the state. We have a chance to lead the nation in the quality of education, but to do that we need to all work together to figure out what works.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","We need to encourage small business to provide employment. We also need to look at child care costs, and help parents who can't afford daycare get back into the work force. Housing costs are an issue, especially in Lamoille county, which has over 65 homeless people, including families. Most importantly we need to decrease the tax burden on the working class, who are losing their homes to tax sale and forclosure, and having trouble putting food on their tables.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Per diem for representatives during special session should be suspended. (We all know how much the budget vote cost us) We need to invest in school security to ensure our students are safe. We need to stop finding new ways to spend incoming money, such as the big tobacco payments. Just because we have this money doesn't mean we need to find something new to spend it on! I believe the taxation of marijuana will provide a large source of income for our state that will help alleviate some of our financial woes.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I am against these gun control Bills. These laws are a violation of constitutional rights that do nothing to improve school security. This feel good legislation (that my opponent supported) only hurts responsible gun owners. Casualties of traffic accidents dwarfs the casualties of gun violence in the last year, and late face it, gun control is not going to stop a criminal from committing a horrific crime. Criminals do not follow laws!","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I have a number of priority issues. Enacting stricter penalties for drug trafficking while making sure addicts have access to treatment is one issue. We hear a lot of talk about the opiate problem, but we have seen no action.
 I would also like to repeal the unconstitutional gun laws recently passed.
 Finally, the tax burden on working vermonters needs to be addressed. When people can't afford to feed their family or cannot hear their houses because they are being bled dry by taxes, that is a major issue!",mike-king

With prevention efforts like RiseVermont we can lower health care costs now and work to keep moving from a ""fee for service"" to an outcomes-based payment system for providers. This will reward the health care system for keeping us healthy.

Improving access to high quality early education (with access to affordable child care as well) and improving workforce development investments are key areas that the state can make a difference right now. Vermont's workforce currently doesn't have the skills to fill all of the jobs we have. Overcoming that challenge by partnering with employers, better-utilizing our tech centers, and engaging students in careers (especially in the trades) will be key to our future economic success. In our Maple Run Unified District, consolidation made a lot of sense, but I don't support a one-size-fits-all approach to school governance.

 I support finding a broad-based statewide funding mechanism to invest in water quality efforts. Cleaner lakes and streams and reduced stormwater/sewer overflows will be good for the economy.

Unfortunately we were not able to make that happen several years ago, as we had hoped. As a step in that direction, I believe we must implement a system of universal primary care. This would save money by encouraging people to seek medical care early, rather than waiting for more expensive treatment or relying on a trip to the emergency room.
 
 I believe we need better education around the benefits of exercise and good nutrition. I would expand these types of public health programs, particularly among low-income people. 
 
 Lastly, given my interest in transportation, in an ideal world I would divert more money to expanding bicycle, pedestrian, and public transit infrastructure to make it easier for people to rely less on their automobiles. Fewer automobiles would also improve air quality, and thus public health.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","We have excellent schools in Vermont, and well supported by their communities. I am strongly opposed to any mandatory student/staff ratios imposed from Montpelier. 
 
 The schools are having to address a host of social issues that require more trained social and mental health workers. The schools are on the front lines of the opioid crisis, and the impacts of poverty caused by income disparity. I believe we are seeing more collaboration between schools and social service agencies, and I would advocate for more. 
 
  I believe we need to look at the proposals for income based property taxes as a way to address funding dilemmas. Income sensitivity has been a great help to many Vermonters and it could be expanded for greater fairness.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I think the best way to do that would be by moving to a $15 an hour minimum wage. Also paid family leave. It is unbelievable to me that we couldn't even pass a very modest family leave bill, when our neighbors across the border in Quebec give one year benefits. People shouldn't have to worry about losing some of their paycheck because of the need to care for an ill family member.
 
 I also believe we should suBSidize child care for all families as Quebec does. This has been a great boon to the Quebec economy. 
 
 It would benefit so many families, encourage them to stay in Vermont, and perhaps attract out of state young people to settle in Vermont.

  I proposed a bill in 2017 to study the economic impact of carbon pricing and cap and trade policies. This bill found its way into a spending priority in this year's appropriations bill. $120,000 will be allocated to study methods of de-carbonization. 
 
 Several proposals currently look promising, such as the ESSEX Plan, and joining the Western Climate Initiative with California, Quebec, and Ontario. There is also the Transportation and Climate Initiative, a collaborative effort among RGGI states to cut transportation emissions.

 The more pressing issues for Vermonters; Affordability, School Funding and Drugs are the most pressing and ignored topics in Montpelier. 
 
 Vermont has the answer, it's called Captive insurance, that along with billing transparency, payment transparency will bring about changes. We can easily bring about better care and lower costs, but with monopolistic control there is no incentive to improve service and reduce costs. 
 
 The statement we are too small to make a difference is a complete fallacy, companies with 65 and 100 employees can make drastic changes for the better, surely a population of 600,000 can find some savings and improvements. We could lead the nation and be the center for Captive Insurance.

Act 46 is a complete failure and everybody knows it.

 We need to put our education funding system on hold, a complete freeze, study and reimplement a plan over the next two years. Simple, transparent and fair. 
 
 We aim to bring affordable day/care education for $95 per week, no state funding required. 
 
 We need to strengthen business, financial and civic education across the boards. 
 
 Trade school education should be expanded. 
 
 Promotion and ease of homeschooling along private schools should be fostered. 
 
 We aim to bring college education down by 70%, while doubling or tripling pay or associate professors, making Vermont a destination state for secondary education.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Vermont has adopted big city social programs that increase and foster generational poverty, our direction and heart need a change. 
 
 We know affordable home ownership can be had for $600 per month. This is affordable on minimum wage. Home owner ship is the best, safest and easiest way to get out of poverty. Vermont does not allow affordable homes to be built. 
 
 Good paying jobs can be in our state if we allow companies to come in. When it takes 10 years to get gas pumps at Costco, & still can't open because you need to change an entire intersection, the permitting process and the good ole boy system of protecting the gas duopoly of Chittenden county needs a bit of sunlight & change.

 Our goal is to reduce the waste/fraud and abuse such that the tax burden is reduced by 25%. While this goal may not be attainable in a two year period, the goal itself will transform the way Montpelier views and assess spending of Tax payer funds. 
 
 Grant money is sorely abused, many programs are considered ""Free Money"" of which there is no such thing. Rich towns steal this free money, mean while those people who truly need assistance are getting the resources needed. At the Disability Awareness Day, it was told the blind have not seen a budget increase in 10 years!

 In every school across our country, every student and teacher knows what students are in trouble. We stand aside and do nothing. Our social systems adopted from big cities create generational poverty, broken families & take away hope. Children pay the price, the consequence of this result in early teen pregnancy, drug use and violence in young men. 
 
 The violence is still in these young men, trying to find their way.

I graduated from Johnson State College in 2015 with a BA in Political Science.,I am a life long Swanton resident. Through out my adult life I have tried be active in local politics.

A universal primary care system will prevent diseases earlier saving the state money. It will also reduce the amount of emergency room visits in the state. I support a bill similar to S.53 to study how to pay for the program. I believe that Vermont should ultimately have a universal healthcare system.,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…",I would support creating a tuition assistance program moving towards to the goal of universal Pre-K. This will make it easier for lower income families to pay for their children's Pre-K. We could possibly use the savings from Act 46 to pay for the program. I also support making the state colleges tuition free for Vermont residents.,"What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?",I support funding education through the income tax. This will reduce the property tax burden on low income Vermonters. I would also support more funding for social welfare programs such as the Reach Up program and 3Squares.,Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,I would support increases in state spending in education and healthcare.,Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,I do support the gun bills that were passed this session. I believe are gun laws needed to be updated and the new laws will make Vermonters safer.,"What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?",My priority issue would instituting a $15.00 minimum wage over period of a couple of years.

 Community College of Vermont","I grew up in Norwich, and I believe that Vermont is exceptional. With that said, we're failing to reach out highest potential on issues from climate change to social justice. I became involved in politics because of Bernie Sanders; I served on the Vermont Democratic State Committee from 2015-17, but quickly lost faith in the Democrats' ability to commit to meaningful progress. I now serve on the Coordinating Committee for the Progressive Party, and, win or lose in November, hope that we can all continue to demand that we get corporate money out of politics (from the bottom up).",https://www.vtdigger.org/images/candidates/NickClark.jpg,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","I support universal healthcare. I have seen [progressive] plans that we can afford on the state level now, and believe that if we lead, the nation will follow. Healthcare for all should cover everyone from prenatal to death, from mental health to opioid use disorder, from hearing to vision. Preventative healthcare does lower long term costs. Universal healthcare does lower working Vermonters' total out-of-pocket costs.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I support universal education, from daycare to college, and believe that we must shift the burden of education from property taxes to a [progressive] income tax (with an exception for second homes). We have some of the best public schools in the nation and we should be proud of that â€“ we should be proud of our educators. We should not succumb to national privatization or centralization trends unless that is what local communities decide for themselves. I also believe we should continue to prioritize the arts, and that school staff deserve to be paid a respectable wage.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","There are two answers: one, we must work to reduce the cost of living, and two, we must work to increase wages, access to education and skill development, and [meaningful] job creation. This covers a vast spectrum of issues from renewal energy and affordable housing, to a livable wage, paid leave, universal education, and reducing payroll taxes for small, local businesses. Ideally, I believe Vermont has the opportunity to foster and encourage green industries and lead the nation on sustainability and renewable energyâ€”we can have a strong environment and economy, from hemp to solar, from permaculture to green technology (with the right grants at our state schools). A green, whole system approach will reduce costs and increase wages for all working Vermonters.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Investments in water treatment plants will save us money on environmental cleanup costs â€“Â I support a revolving loan fund for this purpose. Investments in early childhood education will save money in long term health outcomes. Investments in drug use treatment centers will save us money on law enforcement. We need to pay the liabilities we have now, but we also need to spend strategically with the ideal goal of lowering long term costs as an outcome of having lowered struggling Vermonters', and Vermont's environment's, long term vulnerabilities and needs.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"Vermont has some of the most lenient gun laws in the nation, and simultaneously some of the lowest gun violence rates as well. I trust Vermonters, and gun owners are not bad people. With that said, I support the gun bills that passed, and I would support further [reasonable] bills as well. I know that this is a sensitive topic in America, but nothing should come before the safety of our schools, public spaces, and homes. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I believe all roads start with getting corporate money out of politics. I was proud of our State Senate when S.120, a ban on corporate contributions to Vermont political parties and candidates, was passed last session, and was feverishly outraged when the billed was killed by Democratic leadership in the House Government Operations Committee. This will be my first priority, in or out of office, and it is why I am running as a Progressive against two Democratic incumbents.",nick-clark

We have a societal problem in the US, as well as a mental health crisis that folks are afraid to address. These bills will do nothing to keep children safe, and in my opinion are knee jerk reaction as well as an emotion based decision. Do we have a problem with violence in today's culture? Yes we absolutely do, but limiting magazine sizes and private sale background checks as well as restricting an 18 year old from purchase, will not do nothing to curb this violence. Our schools and public buildings need to be secure and safe and if having an armed resource officer on duty is what it takes then let's do it.

Our government’s decisions and actions should represent both the slightly more than half who are the majority, and the substantial body of citizens who are at that moment the minority. No republic can survive if nearly half the population is routinely denied a share in governing. George Washington warned that political parties would only deepen the divide, with representatives torn between party loyalty and their better judgment. In place of partisanship and polarization, we need to achieve what Jefferson called a “workable consensus” that most of us can accept, even if it leaves each of us a little dissatisfied. This requires moderation.<br /><br />Instead extremes seem to rule the day. We suffer discouragement. Our confidence in government declines. It’s my sense, however, that in between those vocal extremes, most of us are seeking moderation in the public space we share.",peter-berger

It continues to bafffle me that our country spends significantly more than any other developed country for worse results, and that so many - me included - find just affording very high deductible health insurance a major challege. I support a Medicare-for-all style of insurance. Medicare has proven efficient, well-managed and very satisfactory.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","In the past few years, Vermont has passed some significant education system changes, most notably in school governance unification and special education. Act 46 is paying significant dividends in addressing school costs, but is also creating school systems focused on equity for all students and a unified vision of success in those systems. The special education law passed this year will result in better services for students, and cost containment in area where Vermont has been shown to be over-spending.
 
 I believe we need to give these significant, positive changes more time bear fruit before introducing other major changes in K-12 education.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","In this time when decent-paying jobs are going unfilled, we need to study the barriers between those who can be employed and the jobs available. One area where government can help is supporting our career and technical education centers for training and retraining adults in the skills sought by employers.
 
 Another significant barrier is child care in urban and rural areas - both availability and cost. We must re-examine our universal pre-kindergarten system, how it works within our child care system and whether those resources are being used effectively in meeting the needs of families, especially low-income families.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"It is very clear we need to be spending more in protecting the quality of our lakes and rivers, but it must be a system of sustainable funding.

 - Affordable housing is imperative.

Educate our citizens on how societal values are failing our children. Alcohol, drugs, and social dysfunction are putting too large a burden on our public schools and teachers. The model for our public schools is all wrong as pointed out by John Taylor Gotto. We don't need bigger schools that families find it harder to be involved with. We need better teacher to student ratios. A music teacher can teach history through music. A potter can teach about earth science and the clays of Vermont. A history teacher can teach social development and debating and essay writing. An English teacher can teach use of the language, history and social values through literature. Students should not stop searching their interests when the bell rings every hour for 45 minute classes. It hamstrings teachers and students.

Trump, of course is not acting alone but is the symptom of the disease. The far right of the gun world believes there is a ""deep state"" that wants to destroy our country. Trump has named white supremacists and those who believe an autocracy might better represent their ends, his ""elites"", following the Mussolini model. I don't believe those ""elites"" are historically aware of the part they might play in this mad march of tea party mentality turned GOP leaders. BUT, I believe the issue of where to draw the line simply needs more debate, as there are quite a few AR gun owners who do not fall into the category I have just described.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","The giant elephant sitting on the couch in the very center of the room is the corporate takeover of government. Currently that elephant sits squarely in the home of the GOP, but it does like to roam around from party to party. Corporations are not people, though people operate the machinery of the corporate world. The machinery of the corporate system and its relationship to government makes it easy for those people to hide the responsibility of the evil that is perpetuated, for example, in Citizens United. It is the machinery that allows economic disparity to run rampant and avarice to rule. As oligarchy becomes normalized, the citizens left behind grow angry and seek to end errant institutionalization and they rebel. Unfortunately, of the doors that are opened, sometimes the one that leads to fascism is taken. So I would work to end Citizens United, remove corporate money from elections, advance public money for elections. but my priority issue is ""all of the above.""",rob-demic

I think the problem is the ever present need to extract PROFIT out of the provision of health care-the for-profit insurance industry both making medical decisions and injecting themselves into the doctor-patient relationship. 
 
I feel we should take another reasoned shot at providing an option to Vermonters that would take the profit opportunity out but still manage to do what insurance companies do -- get a service discount and simply pay our bills for us. However, not having someone getting paid $12 million+ to oversee the job. We should be able to figure this out. Our state has led the way on so many other issues in its history ... .why not now??","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Well, first let's agree that education at the college/trade school level is just really out of hand cost wise. We as a state contribute very close to the bottom in the ranking of college funding. Overcharging OUT OF STATE students is not a solution. This approach does nothing to control the cost of a good education for Vermonters, and frankly contributes to the long slow bleed of our brightest and best leaving the Green Mountains for the green pasture of other states.
 
Secondly, quality learning experiences in the K and pre-K areas pay back the investment handsomely in the long term. Those are two areas where money is a primary driver or deterrent, depending upon supply.
 
Property taxes are the single most discussed issue you find when a candidate goes door to door. Likewise, funding is ONE of the signifiant factors in the quality of primary education in Vermont. I would re-examine the mix of property and income taxation on citizens to find a better way.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","This is the most challenging question. Rural poverty - the ""last mile"" of poverty, is the hardest to identify and resolve. Rural low income Vermonters face resource, housing, utility, transportation, job and food access issues that most urban poor do not have to master to access services. Urban poor face housing cost and availability issues that make permanent location for job and services provision difficult. Most formula for social services support award more resources to urban than rural, based upon the higher cost of housing and food, but I am not sure that formula is not actually on its head in some respects.
 
 A cookie cutter solution will/has not worked. I worked for 30 years in social services environment and know that the challenges are vastly different. This is indeed the challenge that a dedicated group of lawmakers working Co-operatively with service providers should endeavor to master. Good minds working together to solve a problem. NO is not an option.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I think it is less the total we need to look at, and more the individual spokes on the wheel. We spend far too many tax dollars on keeping people locked away - often FAR away, and the Corrections policy needs to be reexamined for effective control of who needs incarceration and when. It makes no sense that a corrections officer is told they can not incarcerate a probation violation, because the jail is full, while we are paying millions to have offenders locked away in (pick a state). A complete set of tools need to be available to employees.
 
On the other side, unrestricted contracts with private industry to do the job of the state OFTEN and regularly costs the state more in total tax outlay when you consider the money never gets recirculated within our borders. The regenerating impact of a dollar spent within our borders is significant and must be considered.
 
Overall, wise management could reduce total spending and allow for some underfunding to be corrected or lower taxes.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I have been a hunter in the distant past, I like to ""plink"" at a range from time to time and have been a gun owner since I was probably 10 years old. I support the Second Amendment when logically applied, and have no fear that any politician is going to come after any law abiding citizen gun owner. I do not agree that every citizen has a constitutional right to own any firearm they get the impulse to own, do not believe that insuring a gun purchaser is not Barred from owning is a violation of rights, and have serious concerns about the ability of random people acquiring what was once military grade hardware effectively as amusment items. Just as there is a limit on how fast I may drive my car, I feel there is a right to own a gun (if not Barred) but not necessarily the right to own any gun. 
 
Frankly the recent rash of school shootings has caused me to seriously reexamine my position on firearms. However, I am convinced the loophole needs to be closed.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I am becoming very sensitive to plastic contamination in our environment for single use applications like bags in stores.

I would candidly say that we will need to work together to try to insulate Vermont from the excesses of illogic that D.C. seems to be generating, so that our quality of life is not adversely impacted. I think we as legislators OWE that to the citizens of our state.
 
I think we should continue to strive to limit the influence of corporate favor upon our legislative and electoral processes.
 
I would hope to reenergize a movement to find a way to control the cost of health care and insurance company profit. I think we can do better and have several examples in the state to build upon.

Affordable health insurance is key to growing our economy and keeping our communities healthy and strong, but right now, Republicans in Washington are working to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and disrupt the health insurance market, which drives up premiums and threatens access to care. I will work to defend and improve upon the ACA to keep health insurance costs affordable for small businesses, working families and children. Vermont's small population also creates challenges since we don't have the same economies of scale as larger urban areas. This complex issue requires fresh thinking from our legislators, and as a state representative I plan to work with health care professionals, insurance companies, and government to find solutions and improve the marketplace for Vermonters and health care workers.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Strong public schools are key to strengthening our local economy and preparing our children to reach their potential and succeed in life.

I also support H.422, which would allow police to remove firearms from the scene of an alleged domestic violence incident, and S.221, which proposes ""extreme-risk"" gun legislation that would make it easier for authorities to seize guns from those that pose an extreme risk to themselves or others.

The organization that I believe is putting forth a viable option is the PNHP (Physicians for a National Health Program) php.org/pharma
 
 The proposal that PNHP is putting forth, #Beyond the ACA, is bringing the possibility of a single payer system into the public conversation. This proposal replaces the ACA with a publicly financed National Health Program.
 
 H.676 (US House) would have a ""profound and positive effect on American health care"" PNHP website.
 
 
 
 The structure of the NHP is what I would want for Vermonters:
 
 (php.org/pharma)
 
 Provide full medical coverage for all Vermonters
 
 Lower costs by eliminating the profit driven private insurance industry with it's massive overhead and burdensome bureaucracy.
 
 Hospitals, nursing homes, and other provider facilities would be non-profit and costs would be paid for using global operating budgets rather than a fee for service.
 
 
 
 Vermont is currently experimenting with an alternative payment system.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","When it come to Vermont's educational system I am a great believer in the power of a well thought out process in order to find solutions to difficult andcomplex problems. Right now the cost of providing a quality education for Vermont's children and the rising costs of education are becoming unsustainable. What are the trade-offs? 
 
As a teacher/school counselor as well as a School Board member I have a unique perspective on how vital it is to have skilled, competent, caring teachers in our classrooms in order to advance learning. I am also cognizant that the majority Vermonters elected a Governor who took a vow of ""no new taxes or fees.""
 
I would:
 
1. Create a truly representative commission at the beginning of the next legislative session with the charge of finding realistic, evidence-based solutions to this dilemma.
 
2. Document the economic, educational, and cultural outcomes of Act 46.
 
3. Explore any/all new and innovative sources of revenue (ex. retail marijuana market).","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","To be honest, at this point, I can only speak to how I would help low income residents of Colchester and the surrounding region because the reports and data I have been studying are specific to this area (Chittenden County Needs Assessment 2014, Vermont Housing Finance Agency's 2011 annual update ""Housing and Wages in Vermont"").
 
I would increase construction of affordable housing and endorse a minimum wage increase to $15.00 by 2025.
 
There is a growing gap between wages and rising rental costs. Wages lag behind housing costs. Housing is unaffordable for low and moderate income households.
 
A persistently high percentage of Vermonters pay too much for housing - 47  percent of renters and 38 percent of homeowners with mortgages
 
By 2020 nearly 32,000 households (48 percent) will be paying more than 30 percent of their income to housing costs - above 30 percent is not recommended for a sustainable household budget.
 
In conclusion, affordable housing and increased wages will help low income Vermonters.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Again, it's difficult to have an informed opinion on state spending and savings at this point. This is what the Legislature spends the entire session on after extensive research, hearing testimoNY, and being in committee discussions. I have an opinion but I'm not sure how informed it is at this point.
 
 
 
  If elected I will spend as much time as necessary to become informed and knowledgeable as possible about the spending/savings priorities for Vermont and what the trade offs are for each action.
 
 
 
 Areas that need to be 
 
 Opioid addiction treatment
 
 Aging Infrastructure
 
 Marketing, tax incentives, subsidies to responsible and sustainable businesses who want to locate in Vermont-especially in rural areas
 
 Grow Vermont-we need to invest in making Vermont attractive to national and international businesses and new residents in order to increase tax revenues
 
 Incentives for primary care doctors to move to and practice in rural Vermont

To address it, I will request to be appointed to the commission that will be charged with finding solutions to this expensive, very complicated,  devisive, and emotional issue.

At this stage in life, I am a community builder. I serve on the boards of Catamount Arts, a regional and statewide arts leader, and Rural Edge, the NEK's housing agency. I also participate in several town committees, including economic restructuring, energy and housing. 
 
I am motivated today by the urgent need to overcome political polarization to address vital problems. We have a number of systems that need overhaul: education, health care, corrections, transportation, taxation, and energy, to name a few. 
 
I am stepping up to serve because I feel a responsibility to bring a positive and constructive voice in policy discussions.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","I believe we must set a course for a single-payer model. 
 
My wife is a physician and I see the shocking flaws in the current fee-for-service, for-profit system. People are constantly forced to choose between treatment they need and treatment they can afford. Too often medical emergencies become financial emergencies, even bankruptcies. 
 
 
 
 Our mental health system is in even worse condition. Addiction, incarceration, homelessness and suicide are not viable treatment strategies. 
 
 
 
 At the same time, costs continue to spiral. We need to move away from the profit motive as a cost driver. We need to focus on health and not sickness. The new Accountable Care initiative shows promise. 
 
 
 
 Ultimately, we need to agree that health care is a right, not a privilege.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I am troubled by the relentless focus on per-pupil costs as the major metric of success in education. I am troubled by the effect on rural communities of losing their school, and the effect on children of excessive bus rides. It's clear we need efficiencies in administration, but less clear that consolidation is an improvement. 
 
The focus on costs is misleading. We don't truly recognize the added roles we ask our schools to play. Teachers and staff must cope with poverty, drug addiction, violence and abuse, to an extent unthinkable just a few years ago. 
 
As for changes, let's acknowledge that overall we have very good schools -- both public and independent. St. Johnsbury Academy and Lyndon Institute are huge assets to our region and to the state. 
 
I would move to a simpler education funding mechanism. I would have more flexibility for teachers and administrators to experiment with new ideas, and accountability metrics that allow for experimentation, and adjusts when evidence warrants.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Raising the minimum wage and paid family leave -- coupled with adjustments to benefits to allow for a ""ramp"" instead of a ""cliff"" -- are obvious mechanisms to help low-wage workers.
 
In the long run, we need to foster the opportunity and the ability to escape poverty. Job training, subsidized child care, better integrated transportation systems, and stable housing, all would address urgent needs of our lower-income neighbors.
 
We also need to build more nurturing communities. As my doctor wife tells me, life on disability is bad for people. Lack of work, lack of connection, lack of community breeds isolation. Isolation breeds depression and lack of motivation. This is another mechanism that traps people in poverty.
 
 But what nearly everyone who is just scraping by shares is lack of bandwidth to search and follow new opportunities. We should build a society that lowers the threshold to those opportunities, and fosters institutions that treat people at every stage of their lives with dignity.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"As a aspiring member of the Assembly, I don't have enough detail to offer specific prescriptions on spending.
 
In broad strokes, I would rather spend money on education than incarceration. I would rather spend money on counseling and medically assisted drug treatment than on drug interdiction and prosecution. I would rather spend money on energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable generation than on fossil-fuel infrastructure. I would rather spend money on stable housing and mental health treatment than on homelessness services.
 
I agree with Governor Phil Scott, as does everyone, that we need to attract and retain young families. We need jobs, a livable wage, and amenities to do that. We probably agree that far too, but perhaps not with the rest of my list: high-speed internet as a basic utility; quality eduction; more and better housing, both affordable and market-rate; a vibrant arts scene; and great recreation opportunities.
 
We need the courage to invest in prosperity.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I view the current epidemic of gun violence as a public health emergency. It is an untenable situation that our children must train in school how to react to an ""active shooter."" 
 
I respect the right of people to own firearms. I also believe the public has a right not to be terrorized by firearms. We must find a way to balance those rights. 
 
I have been mercifully spared being traumatized personally by guns. But I have friends who have not, and will be traumatized for the rest of their lives. 
 
I don't know what steps are palatable to the folks who opposed Governor Scott's courageous change of heart on this issue. I think they should acknowledge the reality that gun violence is out of hand and suggest some ideas.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I have three.

Having worked in energy efficiency for 25 years, I'm very interested in helping to move the BAll on the legislature's established goals for efficiency and transitioning to renewables.

It's health insurance that's the challenge.
 
Many health insurance plans currently pay for relatively small-cost care (office visit co-pays and the like) while leaving Vermonters to face ruinously high deductibles if they encounter a major health event. As has been pointed out, this is more or less the opposite of the way insurance should work. We need to reorient our health insurance system and participate more in our own health care as we are able. I am open to offering a public option as one of many choices, but it has been amply demonstrated that Vermont cannot go that alone.
 
Health and dental access in very rural areas continues to lag, but in a geographically small state we can facilitate better access for all.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","The first duty we owe to our children is to keep them safe. We must provide whatever resources are required to ensure safe schools so parents do not worry about violence or bullying when they say goodbye to their children in the morning.
 
Public education is key to equity of opportunity, and to informed self-government. Our spending is out of balance, though. The College Board reports that Vermont charges in-state tuition only $30 per year less than the most expensive state, and our out-of-state tuition is the highest in the nation, 150 percent of the U.S. average. We cannot hope to keep young Vermonters in Vermont if they can't get an affordable college education here. 
  
The flip-side of this is that even according to the NEA, Vermont spends far, far more per-pupil in K-12 education than any other state ($23,000+). Simply, we don't have enough students in front of our teachers (Vermont ave: 9.5 vs US ave: 16). I support the governor's initiative to rightsize our student-staff ratio.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I grew up in a household with an unemployed or underemployed friend of the family sleeping on my parents' living room couch almost all the time. My wife and I have also hosted a couple of friends during months-long transitions in their lives. Life can be bumpy; family and social networks (real ones, not Facebook) help to smooth it out.
 
The only sustainable way out of poverty for the able-bodied is working and earning a fair wage. With our state unemployment rate at under three percent for all of calendar year 2018 to date, employers are organically increasing the pay they offer so they can attract and retain quality employees. 
 
Rural poverty and urban poverty differ only in the optics, not the essentials. The essence of life with low income is simply that a person has not yet reached their potential. Offering useful training for actual jobs is helpful. Reaching out to employers to find out what skills they need in employees is smart. And a willingness to try something new is essential.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Generally, state spending should decrease. Smooth roads (and infrastructure) are a sound investment in economic development. Safe schools are a moral imperative. I would favor reasonably more spending in these areas.
 
Everyone else, even very rural states, has figured out how to offer public K-12 education at a far lower price than we do. Yesteryear's taxpayers paid for me to go to public school, and I am happy to pay for today's children to go to public school. Quality public education is a lot smarter, and more morally justified, than the problems that ensue from an uneducated population. But class sizes in the single digits and school sizes in the (low) double digits are indefensible economically, and unadvisable educationally. The governor is on the right track with rightsizing our student-staff ratio. Some of the (substantial) savings here could help to enable Vermonters seeking to attend our state colleges and universities by lowering our very high in-state tuition.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"With one exception (below), all the provisions of S.55 passed by the Legislature in 2018 are unconstitutional and ill-advised. 
 
I support a ban on bump stocks, as this is a device designed to turn a legal weapon into a federally-prohibited machine gun.
 
All the other provisions of S.55 are demonstrably incapable of preventing a mass shooting, which was the impetus for the bill, and ignorant of human rights that the constitutions of the U.S. and of Vermont explicitly protect: the right to defend oneself, one's family, and one's property. Rights are not intersectional, and they are not subject to cost-benefit analysis.
 
 
 
 This is the thin edge of the wedge brought to the safest state in the union by people unaware of, or unwilling to recognize, the true cause of violence, which is not the tool used in the act. Stop trying to amend the second amendment and article sixteen.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My short-term priority is school safety. School leadership and state and local law enforcement collaboration and recommendations should be fully funded.
 
My long-term priority is economic development. Are we going to let Vermont grow into the state that Vermonters want it to be, or are we going to manage decline in the form of a shrinking workforce, shrinking school population, and chronically small economy? 
 
Recognizing limitations on government removes limitations from people. Vermont's economy, the smallest of any state, can only grow its way to sustainability; the state government cannot spend us to prosperity. Growth brings opportunity, and opportunity brings prosperity. To everyone.
 
 
 
 Our heavy tax burden (54percent above US average [digger, 7/13]) and cumbersome permitting process act as a headwind to innovation and entrepreneurship.

My neighbors, family, and local folks in Vermont cannot access the affordable health care that they need. They are uninsured, underinsured, or can't afford the premiums and co-pays. many in my district are struggling -- living paycheck to paycheck and they are denied access to health care.

I worked to preserve the current school choice system: towns with school choice should be able to keep it unless town voters decide otherwise.

The state should support businesses that employ local workers and compensate them appropriately, help create jobs that pay a livable wage and provide incentives or seed grants to small businesses that want to develop in our communities.

It is an economic development issue and a significant driver in income inequality. My goal is a publicly-funded universal health care system. To accomplish that end, Vermont must continue its push to reduce health care inflation by: supporting access to primary care as the least expensive, most efficacious care; empowering the Green Mountain Care Board to regulate hospital costs and health insurance rates; fostering a health care system that rewards quality care and healthy outcomes instead of more tests and procedures; and reducing pharmaceutical pricing.
 
 We do not have adequate health care unless we have adequate access to quality, affordable mental health care and addiction treatment. Access to in-patient and emergency mental health care is totally inadequate and must be a capital investment priority. Vermont must continue to enhance pay scales for mental health and addiction care providers.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Local school systems address the societal ills that flow from an opioid addiction epidemic, increased rates of childhood poverty, a mental health crisis, and our society's growing income inequality. While we pay close attention to education spending and property tax rates, we have failed to more closely examine what our education dollars are going toward. Local school budgets are being used to shore up the social safety net, which has frayed from deferred spending under the weight of a ""no new taxes or fees"" campaign pledge.
 
Children who are hungry, neglected, or suffering through mental health or addiction crises are not ready learners. Like the work Vermont has done to better avail citizens of wrap-around services in health and elder care, we need to assess how to more efficiently deliver social services to children in school.
 
 When it comes to budgeting, governance issues, consolidation questions, and education policy choices, local control results in better decisions and outcomes.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Low-income Vermonters face challenges from stagnant wage growth and access to affordable housing, health care, and child care. Continuing to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit and reducing the strain of the ""benefits cliff"" policies that incentivize work are good for low-income Vermonters and for employers in need of more employees. While increasing the minimum wage incentivizes work, simultaneous lost child care assistance can have the opposite effect. We must increase child care subsidies in lockstep with minimum wage increases, while growing the number of qualified child care providers.
 
 With regard to non-governmental solutions that deserve public support, I have seen positive results from the Bridges Out of Poverty program (promoted locally by the Upper Valley Haven). The program helps employers and social service groups better understand the challenges faced by people in poverty resulting in more successful mentoring, health outcomes, and transitions from welfare to work.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"With years of under-funding our social safety net, many programs serving the most vulnerable deserve more funding. Prioritizing Parent Child Centers and designated agencies providing mental health and addiction treatment for increased funding is very productive spending serving vulnerable populations.
 
 For economic growth and job creation we need to prioritize funding for post-secondary education and worker training programs over more traditional economic development programs with more opaque job creation results. Our best job creation expenditures will focus on economic infrastructure: well-educated graduates ready to work; fast, accessible internet; social programs (affordable, accessible child care and health care) that attract young families.
 
 Vermont annually spends hundreds of millions of dollars on tax expenditures and special tax exemptions. Per the 2011 Blue Ribbon Tax Commission, we need to prioritize which special tax exemptions are supporting our desired policy outcomes.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I supported them, enthusiastically.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","As a senior member of the House Health Care Committee, I will be focused on protecting Vermonters from the Trump administration's assaults on the Affordable Care Act. President Trump's undermining of the Affordable Care Act, if left unaddressed, will result in more expensive health insurance, more uninsured Vermonters, and a proliferation of policies that provide little financial protection for consumers. The Trump administration is also attacking the ability of women to make their own reproductive health decisions. I will prioritize expanding a woman's access to contraceptives and protecting the right to choose whether to end a pregnancy.
 
 I would like to continue work done this past session on more closely linking local school tax rates to local school spending decisions. This will entail eliminating the use of one-time funding sources for the Ed Fund, while moving Ed Fund spending programs not reflected in local school budgets to the General Fund.",tim-briglin

It costs too much and provides too little. I support national single payer health care. However, I am skeptical of Vermont's ability to ""go it alone"" to create such a system. Controlling health care costs means less profit for providers and insurance companies. If Vermont alone tries to restrict what we pay doctors and hospitals, we will have fewer doctors and hospitals. They will go elsewhere.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Act 77 calls for Vermont to move to ""proficiency based learning"" (PBL). According to AOE: ""The focus of proficiency-based learning is on students' demonstration of desired learning outcomes... This is in contrast to traditional systems which advance students based on seat time."" I would support such an approach, but the implementation of Act 77 locally does not appear to head in this direction. Instead the focus seems to be to implement ""proficiency based grading"" (PBG). PBG replaces ABCDF with 1234, with the apparent goal of everyone getting a 3 ""meets the standard"". The practical result of this grading system, which is already being used, is to remove the motivation to excel and get good grades. Students are learning that if they put out modest effort, turn in stuff a day late, they can get a 3. If they work hard, meet deadlines, do extra credit work, they still get a 3.

Making health insurance more affordable and ensuring Vermonters have access to treatment without barriers for drug addiction and mental health is critical. All Vermonters should be able to afford to rent, buy, and own a home. 
 I would prioritize funding to ensure that every Vermonter suffering from addiction or mental illness gets timely treatment, work to make health insurance affordable for working families and children, insist on getting value for our health care dollars, with common sense measures that pay hospitals and doctors for how well they take care of patients, instead of for performing more procedures and tests, and fund programs that protect and create safe and affordable housing for working families and vulnerable seniors.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Our public schools are the bedrock of our VT communities and provide our children the opportunity to reach their potential and succeed in life. With the additional demands placed on our schools from addiction, mental illness, and poverty, great public schools in all our communities are more important than ever in giving all children a fair shot at a bright future. It's been nearly two decades since VT rethought how we fund our schools. It's time to find a new solution that upholds our support for great public schools, with local accountability and with all VTs contributing their fair share, including the wealthiest. It's time we create a Spec. Ed. system that is more effective and uses our resources wisely. By giving schools more flexibility they can focus on student needs without having to worry if a service is eligible for reimbursement. We're increasing access to high quality and affordable child care and expanding access to pre-kindergarten for every child.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Today, too many Vermonters struggle to care for and support themselves and their families in both rural and urban settings. Making paid family leave part of every job, gradually raising the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay for women improves the lives of Vermont's working families, puts more money into Vermont's small businesses and helps our communities to thrive.
 Working Vermonters should have the security of being able to welcome a new child or care for a sick family member without fear of losing income or being fired. No family in Vermont should have to choose between a paycheck and the health of their child or the well-being of an elderly parent. By gradually raising the minimum wage in Vermont to $15 an hour, so families can meet the basics, their spending will boost our local economies, create jobs and help Vermont communities to thrive. We need to continue to increase access to training, career and tech education so every Vermonter has a fair shot.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,Clean water funding needs to be increased and a long term funding mechanism identified. See additional response to this issue below.,Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support the gun violence bills that were passed this year. 
 The General Assembly passed three laws to address gun violence. Act 97 (S.221) will allow law enforcement to show a judge that an individual presents an extreme risk of harm to himself, herself or others in order to obtain an Extreme Risk Protection Order, requiring the person to relinquish any dangerous weapons. Act 92 (H.422) allows law enforcement to temporarily remove firearms from the scene of a domestic violence incident. Act 94 (S.55) expands the requirement for background checks to include private sales, places restrictions on the sale of firearms to those under age 21, limits the transfer and possession of high-capacity ammunition magazines, and bans the transfer and possession of bump-fire stocks. Together, these policies will make it more difficult for individuals who intend harm to themselves or others to obtain firearms and will reduce the lethality of firearms that may be misused.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Water quality is a top priority for me. Clean water legislation doesn't just work to make our lakes cleaner; it drives the state's tourism industry, promotes Vermont's brand and its businesses, keeps our children's drinking water safe, and maintains the clean, natural landscape that makes this state so special.
 Of concern to me is that we have not identified a long term funding source to fully implement the many projects that will be required to meet our obligations under Vermont's agreement with the EPA. The EPA called out this deficiency in their latest report on Vermont's efforts to date. I will strongly advocate in my committee, the House Natural Resources, Fish and Wildlife, to continue our work with the VT Administration, Agency of Natural Resources, Agency of Agriculture, Agency of Transportation, appropriate committees of the House and Senate, and other stakeholders.",trevor-squirrell

The feds and state have added unfunded mandates which have tied the hands of educators. School choice should be an option for bullied children and others who's school does not meet the needs of the student. Each school has its own unique characteristics.

Parents know what's best for their child vs. the state when it comes to what school a child can thrive in.,"What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","The above questions about min. wage and paid family leave fall into this question. To fund family leave, A 0.136percent payroll tax is similar to a ""savings account"" which you may not ever use. This is a tax on all workers including Senior Citizens working at WalMart to pay for medication to a single Mom living paycheck to paycheck. Eg. If you (or household combined income) earn $600. per wk, less tax (.136percent) $8.16 per week x 52 weeks = $424.32 Let's say you're 30 and work until you're 62 years old and never receive a raise. $425.32 x 32 yrs= $13,578.24 taken from you, to receive ""paid"" leave for a few weeks, if you even ever use it. Placing that $13,500 into a savings account, you would have more money, to spend as you choose. The min. wage debate starts in the middle. Because of our Montpelier majority's policy, jobs have been fleeing our state along with our youth. I would work toward a business-friendly state where paychecks are much higher than min. wage.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"We can spend the same and spend smarter. Our state budgets should start at zero each year. Agencies may have one-time spending needs but each year agencies should create a budget, with the needs of that year in mind. by having to account for spending, we can have more oversight. Agencies can be combined to diminish redundant jobs or jobs which may overlap. This ensures that there will be less which falls in the cracks. Montpelier should remember that each dollar comes from hard-working Vermonter's who are having the challenge to keep up with increased costs of living here. When taxes were raised on non-residential property is wasn't the ""rich"" who were affected. It was landlords who will need to raise rent prices just to stay even and businesses who own their property. By keeping costs level it creates an opportunity for a reprieve of higher costs for our residents and businesses.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I am disappointed that it seemed that the gun bill was the goal vs. school safety. I've not heard a continuation of the discussion of how to keep our schools safe. Each school, it's layout, etc, is unique. Our local residents should be giving input which is listened to, on how to make our schools safe. The gun bill seemed to be the goal vs the beginning of school safety discussion. None of the shootings I know of would have been prevented because of this new law, however, for example, a young woman wouldn't be able to purchase a gun for protection after leaving an abusive relationship without taking a course, which may be too late.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Gov. Scott's 6-3-1 sums it up. Six fewer workers in the Vermont workforce every day. With Vermont having a low population and one which is the second most aged state in the nation, 6 fewer people working to support our state's financial tax needs is not sustainable. Three fewer children in Vermont's public school system every day. While we are teaching fewer children, costs are rising. This also is not sustainable. One baby born in Vermont every day to a mom addicted to drugs.

A serious medical event should not cause hardworking Vermonters to have to declare bankruptcy or spend decades with outstanding bills weighing them down. That said, Vermont simply is not big enough to go it alone. Our population base isn't large enough to cover the expenses a larger safety net would require. I would like to see the state move towards partnership with other states for a shared expense burden that would allow all Vermonters the protection of solid health care without overburdening our state's tax base.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Vermont's education system is stagnant and underserving our children. Local school boards do not have true control when the schools they oversee are loaded with unfunded mandates and teachers find their plans derailed by an excess of standardized testing. The state needs to partner with and support our local school boards, but allow the school boards to be in the driver's seat when it comes to innovative solutions for the challenges their communities of learners face. We need to insure that no children are left behind, but we also need to make absolutely certain that our children have the opportunity to thrive.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Low-income Vermonters deserve the opportunities to make a better, more secure life for themselves and their children. They would be well served with access to the education needed to adapt to ever-changing employment opportunities, as well as access to healthy foods. Additionally, while the state's drug problems reach across every income level, it is lower-income urban neighborhoods that see the brunt of related criminal activity. Giving local municipalities the assistance needed to establish, and maintain, dedicated police foot patrols in such neighborhoods would greatly improve quality of life for the law abiding Vermonters living there.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Generally speaking state spending needs to be decreased. In my community of Rutland City the tax burden makes for a climate discouraging to both homeownership and the business community. While there are areas of our state that need and deserve comprehensive funding -- health care, education, public safety -- it is my belief that many needed increases could be accomplished with belt tightening and elimination of waste and redundancies in other state activities.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I think Vermonters of all ages deserve the right to go about their lives without fear of random acts of gun violence and I commend state government for a willingness to address this issue. I believe, however, that until we address the treatment of mental illness in our communities we limit our steps towards a solution. We also need to address the illegal procurement of guns and tighten the means to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable. Until this is worked through comprehensively we risk infringing the rights of law abiding hunters and hobbyists without actually increasing the net safety level for our state as a whole.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My local community, like many others throughout the state, suffers dual hits from a high tax burden and declining population.

Vermont has a number of programs that support these concerns which I am in favor of. Unfortunately, Vermonters are seeing increased premiums as well as increased costs of medicines whereas pensions, social security and Medicare benefits are not keeping up. Health care must remain affordable for all Vermonters. There has been an effort to computerize medical records which was to save physicians time so that they could concentrate on their patients. Physicians are still spending a great deal of time with paper work and perhaps now other ways must be found to lighten their load. Vermont also has an aging population and there have been innovations with trying to keep the elderly in their homes through assisted living which I also support. Another issue in rural areas is ambulance service. Support of this essential service is needed through the legislature.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Now is the time to find another way in which to finance Vermont's educational system.

 The state needs to do more in assisting area dairy farmers whose hard work literally brings in billions of dollars to the state. Vermont's farmers also attract tourists to the area with their open lands and bucolic farms, it is time for Vermont to assist our farmers until the world's milk market changes.

We've used our federal block grant to develop innovative programs. The most recent is a pilot program of block payments to providers rather than a fee for service model. We weren't able to pull together a single payer system, but this year I did support a bill for free primary care. health care is a complicated system. First we must do not harm.

At the same, time we must get the cost of education under control. I think we have identified the base problem. Our student population has been declining for a decade leaving many small school without adequate funds to provide a quality education. Opiate addiction and stagnant wages among the voting public have only exacerbated the problem. It's taken us years to dig this hole and it will take a few years to get out of it. Act 46 was meant to force citizens to look at the financial realities of there schools and to consider merging into larger, more financially viable units.

We cannot continue to allow insurance and hospital executives to command salaries sometimes in the multiple millions and then tell our nurses and other hospital staff that they cannot count on a living wage commensurate with their training and experience. In an ideal world, I would expand Medicare access, but current Federal law makes this nearly impossible. Vermont needs to implement single-payer health care, while at the same time recruiting medical professionals to work in more rural areas across the state to ensure we eliminate disparities in health care access and utilization between our most rural and our most urban areas.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Every child in Vermont deserves a quality education that prioritizes and reflects our collective cultural, social and community values. We must acknowledge the significant role our educational institutions play in our rural areas and fight to ensure our educational system affords every child the highest quality instruction and services, regardless of race, class and geographical location. Working with communities to create partnerships that reflect shared values and high quality instruction is critical to the continued educational success of our students. We need to keep our education dollars local and support our public schools throughout Vermont. Public education dollars need to be used to fund public schools, not out-of-state private schools. If we are going to allow voucher dollars to be used for private school tuition, the voucher amount should be prorated to bring voucher spending in line with Gov. Scott's student-staff ratio that applies to Vermont public schools.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","We need to raise our minimum wage, keep rural elementary schools open while finding ways to partner with the State and other area schools as children progress through our public schools, and prioritize addressing early childhood trauma and adverse childhood experiences. Research shows that the impacts of poverty leave lasting scars on children and families, and poverty related stress significantly impedes early brain development. Early intervention with families in crisis is critical to improve public health and educational outcomes for all Vermonters. We need to work with our communities across the state to address raw sewage overflow into our rivers, lakes, and streams, while also partnering with dairy farms to create sustainable solutions to waste runoff to ensure every Vermonter lives in a healthy environment. We also need to prioritize housing development at all price levels to grow our population base to fund infrastructure development and social program expansion.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Mental health treatment, treatment options for vulnerable adults, and substance use and abuse treatment and prevention are critically underfunded and have been for years. Many people end up caught between the criminal legal system and the mental health system with few options for successful treatment in either. Adults in need of guardianship are also caught in a cumbersome system with proceedings that often lack due process in critical phases of the guardianship appointment process. Guardianships should be exclusively handled in the family court division, meaning more resources will need to be allocated to fund our courts adequately. 
 We also need to look to alternatives to tax abatements to attract businesses to our state. The state can invest in education and infrastructure to build a skilled and trained workforce, public spaces, and other enhancements to potential business sites that make Vermont competitive in the business landscape that don't involve tax breaks to corporations.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I largely agree with the bills that were passed last session, though enforcement of the high-capacity magazine ban is a legal minefield. Additionally, I don't believe a blanket prohibition on anyone under the age of 18 owning a firearm is a solution to the gun-related violence we're experiencing here in Vermont. I've worked with many young adults who are properly trained and educated in firearm safety and use who should be permitted to possess a firearm. I've also seen many folks over the age of 18 purchase and possess firearms who have no safety or practical training related to safe and responsible firearm ownership and use. The creation of an extreme risk protection order could be a helpful tool, but the resources do not currently exist to adequately utilize these orders as intended.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Expanding state supported access to community and technical colleges for every Vermonter is a necessary and critical tool to meet current and future workforce demands. As a community college faculty member for over five years, numerous students who sat in my classrooms here in central Vermont are now professionals working in their desired field. Community and technical colleges provide access to higher education for a diverse mix of our residents and create pathways to employment for many who would otherwise be shut out. We need to support and fund the Vermont State College system to afford every Vermonter the opportunity to succeed in the classroom and in the workforce by incentivizing people to attend VSC institutions in exchange for a period of civil service to the State to repay a substantial portion of their education. We can fund the budget expansion for VSC by creating a regulatory system and structure for marijuana and other THC-based products.",ashley-a.-hill

I started college the Fall of 1976 and graduated the Fall of 1979. Since then, I enrolled in the CFP Professional Education Program with the College for Financial Planning completing the program in March of 1995, passed the CFP Boards that Summer, and earned the CFP designation in October of 1995.","Bill Huff is both a retired airline pilot of 29 years and a retired Certified Financial Planner of over 20 years. After graduating from Purdue University, Bill spent nearly five years flying a variety of light aircraft as a bush pilot in Southwestern Alaska. Hired by TWA, he flew widebody airliners both domestically and internationally, starting as a Flight Engineer, progressing to First Officer, and then Captain. American Airlines acquired the assets of TWA and Bill continued to fly as Captain until retiring in 2015.
 
 As an investment advisor and Certified Financial Planner, Bill took pride in educating and explaining investing to many first-time investors, as well as implementing complex strategies for those with more advanced financial needs. 
 
 Since retirement, Bill has served the Town of Thetford as chair of the Board of Civil Authority for two terms and was appointed to a Selectboard seat to fulfil the term of an exiting member.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/themes/vtd_s/election_files/huff.jpg,No,No,No,No,Yes,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","We need more insurers operating in the state to increase competition, provide more choice for subscribers, and help lower the premium costs. The ability to buy insurance across state lines would be a start toward meeting the above mentioned goals.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Act 46, like so much legislation that comes out of Montpelier these days, was meant to help the urban areas around Burlington. Almost immediately after passage, several mergers took place in and around Burlington, that were able to take advantage of the financial incentives within the bill. The remainder of the state, was left hanging to patch something together as best they could. Act 46 needs to be revisited to accommodate rural areas. I understand the need to rein in costs, but young children (K-6) need to be educated near home. Bussing older children to a school serving a wider region would allow for a larger curriculum, AP classes, and more extra curricula choices than could be had in some small rural schools if left by themselves. I think this ""Hybrid"" approach to Act 46 might help rural Vermonters.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","A strong social safety net is needed for those that are unable to care for themselves. I think most Vermonters, given the choice, would much rather accept a hand up, rather than a handout, however. Vermont's economy needs to grow and attract businesses that can provide more jobs and better paying jobs. A rising tide floats all boats. More jobs and better paying jobs could help many families make ends meet more easily.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Spending needs to be prioritized. We can't continue to spend money on every pet project that comes along while the State continues to shed population, jobs, and stand by while our old and crumbling infrastructure haunts us nearly daily. Are we really going to give away thousands of dollars to bribe someone to move to Vermont. And look at the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on the extra legislative session this year. Those two things alone amount to nearly a million dollars that could be spent on upgrading sewage treatment plants or providing badly needed benefits to our National Guard men and women.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"S55 did nothing to enhance school safety or the safety of the public at large. As a pilot that was flying on 9-11, I have taken the lessons learned from that event and altered the procedures implemented in the aftermath to make our schools safer. Some of the details for the ""Vermont Safe School Task Force"" are on my website. Students, Teachers, and Administrators need to realize they are a target. They didn't ask to be and don't want to be a target but the choice was not theirs to make. Once they firmly understand what that means, they are much more likely to make choices to help themselves rather than to simply try to blame some one else or some other group for their problems and insist that ""somebody do something"". I was a pilot. But as a pilot in todays' world, I needed to be trained in much more than flying skills to protect the flying public. It is sad that teachers can't just be left alone to teach, but that is not the reality we live in.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","In general, we need to improve the Vermont economy by attracting or growing businesses. More jobs and better paying jobs will make it easier for families to make ends meet, will provide more revenue to State coffers from both corporate and individual taxes, and stem the tide of Vermonters fleeing the home they have grown up in. Specifically, we need to improve the benefits of our National Guards men and women to be competitive with neighboring states. These are talented, skilled, motivated individuals that will provide an immediate improvement to the Vermont economy if they can be persuaded to stay here rather than relocate elsewhere.",bill-t.-huff

Sometimes we lose sight of that in our rush to figure out how to spend less. With regard to that topic, I commend Act 46, which has been successful in incenting the consolidation of school districts while maintaining local control and has led and will continue to lead to lower costs. Other steps we need are the special education census block grants that were just passed, pre-K redesign, and statewide teachers' health insurance recognizing that they will streamline expenses, but they will not generate magic savings that can be spent elsewhere as the governor proposes. I would certainly consider making changes to the funding formula, but I would also try to ensure that Vermonters understand that the income sensitivity in our current property tax system does keep taxes down for those who need it most.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","The two best steps that the state could make to help low-income Vermonters are to ensure that more affordable housing is built and to raise wages to a livable level. Having worked on social justice issues that affect low-income persons for most of my career, these are issues that I care about deeply. Housing is every family and individual's single largest expense, and when people pay more than 30 percent – and even more than 50 percent – on their housing, they have no money left to pay for other essentials. We have far too many Vermonters who pay these high percentages. On the other side of the equation, for decades wages have not kept up with expenses, forcing Vermonters to work two to three jobs to make ends meet, and so the minimum wage must be increased as well. This measure will also help our businesses by enabling consumers to afford goods and services. The goal of state government should be to help low-income Vermonters succeed on their own, without needing to depend on social programs.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I think we should invest more in the measures that would make Vermont more livable to those who are already here, and more attractive to those who might move here: affordable housing, child care, health care being the three biggest ones. If we found public ways to pay for these important items rather than forcing either families and individuals or businesses to pay for them independently, we would save money in the long run, have a better chance to lower costs, and have a stronger sense of community by pooling and resources and helping one another rather than having an ""every man for himself"" attitude. I would pay for these items by taxes such as an occupancy tax on hotel stays, by taxing a regulated marijuana industry and by taxing pharmaceutical companies for opioid sales, for example.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I voted in favor of all the gun safety legislation that was passed and co-sponsored the universal background check bill. I think these measures ""to ban bump stocks, limit the number of rounds in magazines, and take guns away from domestic abusers and those intent on harming themselves or others, in addition to universal background checks"" are all common-sense legislation that does not interfere with anyone's Second Amendment rights or our culture of hunting and sportsmanship.

Other priorities include advancing universal primary care, by participating through my role on Health and Welfare in the process we set up to move this along; to work with Appropriations and the Education Committee to find more funding for child care; to introduce a bill to promote and fund more affordable housing; and to introduce legislation that would set up a pilot program for opioid addiction prevention based on the highly successful Icelandic model.",debbie-ingram

In lower income areas I would expand the out of school services offered by the school to make sure that no child ever goes home hungry or to a hostile home.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","The most immediate step is raising the minimum wage to $15/hour. If the argument is that minimum wage isn't meant to be comfortable, that is to say that those workers do not deserve to live. The second change is single payer health care.

I would also look into a state jobs program to make sure those in search of employment find it.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"This is a broad question. As a social democrat, I have a strong belief in the responsibility of a society to protect its most vulnerable. The government must increase its spending on education, social services and health care. I do believe that many areas of the government are bloated, however. We must lower the amount we spend on prisons, especially private. The comes along with lowering sentences and reexamining the criminality of drugs offences. If we spend in ways that are smart, especially anti-poverty measures, we will repeat massive dividends.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support Scott's willingness to take action on guns. I would like to see larger regulations placed on firearms however. We can easily preserve the ability of hunters to continue their sport while keeping our society free of violence. I will support measures to strengthen background checks and extend waiting periods, as well as restricting weapons with no hunting application.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My most passionate issue is one of massive reform. First Past the Post (our current voting system) creates a false dichotomy between two parties, and allows them to keep a stranglehold on acceptable political debate. I advocate strongly for switching Vermont state elections to Ranked Choice Voting (alternatively known as Instant Runoff Voting). This system allows for smaller candidates to gain votes without voters fearing the spoiler effect. I believes abolishing First Past the Post is a crucial first step to accomplishing reforms that are widely supported among citizens but not their politicians (for example Single Payer has more than a healthy majority of support).",finnian-boardman-abbey

For example, offering some form of restrictions (perhaps ankle bracelets) both pre-arraignment and post arraignment for certain individuals we could save money by not having them incarcerated - in addition to treating them better. The same thing is true with mental health - we have critical care beds but then there are no step down beds.

Since then, we've become very active in our community. At present, I am a member of the Essex Planning Commission and Lay Leader at Essex Center United Methodist Church. I've been an educator in Chittenden County Schools since 2006. We're very proud to have our own little future student at home in the form of our son Everett. More than anything, I'm running to build a better future for him.",https://www.vtdigger.org/images/candidates/JoshuaKnox.jpg,Yes,No,Yes,Decline to Answer,No,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","Given that Vermont is a small and aging state, I take it as axiomatic that we can't go it alone; our state economy & finances won't support such a unilateral change such as state single-payer. With that in mind, I propose seeking to join the health care insurance market of Massachusetts (so-called RomneyCare). As part of a larger insurance pool, other reforms such as an all-payer model (like that of Maryland) or the sort of public option as originally imagined for the Affordable Care Act could be on the table for Vermont. This would allow us to address the problem from two angles: firstly, that of cost containment; secondly, that of providing access to those who cannot obtain it through an employer. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, but this moves us in the right direction.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","It's crucial here for me to reiterate that I am currently an educator in Vermont's public schools, so I absolutely have interest and knowledge on this important issue. As such, for any education legislation to obtain my support, it would need to pass a simple test: would it work in an actual classroom? Too often legislators - with the best of intentions, to be clear - pass legislation that treats education as a simple input-output machine that can be re-worked to obtain desired results. My years in the classroom have taught me that the human element is the most vital of all. The goal of education is simply this: a fully formed human being. I know from experience that this goal is best achieved when teachers, students, parents, and the community at large are all on the same page. Our laws, therefore, should reflect the experience of teachers, students, parents, and communities and support them.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Poverty is isolation. In an urban setting, that can mean that residents of certain neighborhoods are excluded from the general prosperity surrounding them. In rural areas, it can mean a more literal physical separation from resources and social capital. In either case, the solution is community, writ large. As a member of the Essex Planning Commission, I have learned of the impact (good or bad) that planning & zoning can have on low-income Vermonters. Bad zoning and regulations can create a climate in which it's well-nigh impossible to build affordable housing, and low-income residents are kept at the margins. Good regulations can encourage the creation of affordable neighborhoods within walkable distance of public goods such as parks, schools, jobs, and transit. If elected, I would absolutely look at how Act 250 has influenced this process in Vermont communities, rural and urban alike, and seek amendments if necessary.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"In addition to planning and affordable housing, a spending priority of mine would be mental health. Simply put, indicators of mental health - especially in the younger generation - are on a concerning trend. Individuals with mental health diagnoses should absolutely get the support (medical or community-based) they need, and I support increased state spending to that effect. 
 
 I believe that this would have a secondary effect of helping to reduce the use of illegal drugs as self-medication and therefore address the opioid epidemic in Vermont, especially if addressed in tandem with the issue of poverty as isolation (see my answer above). 
 
 I also support the expansion of parental/family leave programs on the same grounds, namely that people should not have to raise a child in isolation and without help. We're all in this together.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"To be honest, I have mixed opinions of the package as a whole. 
 
 As a teacher, I am in a unique position with respect to school shootings, since my most common thought after such a nightmare as the Parkland shooting is ""Could that have been me? Will it be me next time?"" But at the same time, many of my fellow teachers as well as our students are hunters who have spoken out against what they see as the arbitrariness of banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. Both are important perspectives to consider. 
 
 That said, I am far more supportive of S.221, the so-called 'Extreme Risk' provisions that allow for weapons confiscation in specified extreme cases. These cases are no longer about responsible gun ownership, but preventing imminent harm.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My theme, as I trust you've seen throughout, is repairing the bonds of community (however so achieved) and creating a human-scale Vermont. The most important piece at the political level is achieving full representative democracy. I am in this race for State Senate precisely our State Senate districts are so *un*representative. By using a multi-member at-large method of election, Chittenden sends an entirely Democratic/Progressive slate to the Senate in spite of tens of thousands of votes for Republican candidates. Likewise, Rutland sends an entirely Republican delegation to the Senate, despite tens of thousands of votes for Democratic candidates. A similar district in the State of Georgia has been thrown out by federal courts for violating for Voting Rights Act because it, quote, ""used at-large voting as a structural wall of exclusion..."" If elected, my priority is to replace our at-large system with a system of proportional representation and bring *all* voices to the table.",joshua-h.-knox

  A system of relegating money on a per student basis would give communities choices.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","The state of Vermont has many programs in place to help low income Vermonters. As a legislator I would seek which programs are working, which ones excel and which ones are failing . The state could then capitalize on the successes, eliminate the wasteful programs, and find out if there are any deficiencies that need to be rectified.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"The state spending should at least be leveled off. We could decrease some spending through efficiencies while there might be increases where it can't be avoided.
 
 Some decreases could be made by elimination of the deputy commissioners that have been increasingly added with each new administration. 
 
 The use it or lose it budget appropriations need to be eliminated, if a department has a surplus at the end of the year it should be set aside for that dept. for a four year period to overcome a shortfall or for a project.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"The gun bills passed by this legislature are unconstitutional. 
 
  There is an element of age discrimination with the justification of requiring a hunter safety course for those less than 21 years old. Also a hunter safety course is not a firearm education course; the purpose of article 16 is not for hunting.

  These duly elected officials have decided what you as law abiding Vermonters can have or can't have.

I have a great concern that the All-Payer plan will prove disastrously expensive and disruptive for Vermont's health care system. This is far too important to Vermonters to get wrong.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","There is an ongoing debate over cost containment in the Vermont school system vs community choice and quality education. I don't believe these have to be mutually exclusive. I do believe that Act 46 may be too draconian in terms of forcing communities into school mergers to which they are bitterly opposed. I would like to see more use of tele-education to help the smaller schools, just as we are utilizing tele-medicine to help spread specialty medical care to the smaller, rural hospitals. On the post-secondary level, we must continue to expand community college, technical training, and paid internships to meet the needs of students and employers. And I firmly believe we should be providing more state subsidies to our flagship university (UVM), so that more academically eligible Vermont high school graduates can stay in-state.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","We have - in effect - two Vermonts...Chittenden County and the rest of the state. And the approach to poverty may differ as well. A minimum wage of $15 in Chittenden County may be effective in Chittenden County, with its higher cost of living; whereas it may be destructive to struggling small businesses in other parts of the state. In Chittenden County we have a higher percentage of homeless people and of new refugees, both of which may require specialized assistance. In the more rural areas, the dire challenges facing the dairy industry must be addressed, as well as the lack of start-up or investor money.

Next year, the legislature will seek to reduce administrative costs, and to implement the ""all payer"" model. The proposal is designed to reward providers for helping their patients stay healthy, rather than simply to reimburse more medical procedures. 
 
 
 
 Deciding which gaps to fill, should federal funds decline, will be the biggest budget challenge of the next legislative session, as health care remains the fastest growing share of our state budget.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","Orange County experience the second-greatest benefits from Act 60 of any county in the state. Our schools gained equal access to state funding, as 80 percent of Vermonters paid their local education taxes based upon their income, not their homes' value. This funding system continues to serve Vermonters well, and Vermont students regularly score in the top 4-6 states in national testing. 
 
 
 
 Lack of proper broadband in many rural areas threatens rural schools and communities. The key groups eager to settle in Vermont all demand access to broadband and shun underserved areas. The quality of our local schools depends not just upon a fair funding formula, but also upon the rich diversity of families that stimulate innovation and prosperity in rural Vermont. 
 
 
 
 Act 60 and Vermont's first-in-the-nation mandate that the phone companies provide touch-tone service both helped make small towns business-friendly. Today, broadband access has replaced touch-tone phones as a world standard.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Vermont's leaders have always balanced the needs of Vermont's working classes with those of the ""investor class,"" and have never let one or the other monopolize all new income growth. Since the Great Recession, the gap between working Vermonters and the top 10 percent has grown alarmingly. 
 
 
 
 Earlier this year, the Vermont legislature passed a modest minimum wage bill to be phased in over several years. The legislature also passed a modest family leave bill, to be funded by working Vermonters and with exemptions for the smaller Vermont businesses. 
 
 
 
 Both bills were vetoed. Both! Working Vermonters deserve better.
 
 
 
 Low-income Vermonters spend a higher percentage of their income on heat and transportation, and are hurt most when Vermont falls behind its schedule to get off fossil fuels in favor of renewables. Energy efficiency and weatherization programs save all Vermonters money and keep Vermont dollars in Vermont putting Vermonters to work.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"Increase spending

 Spend economic development dollars nurturing new Vermont industries. Don't spend money propping up dinosaurs.
 
 
 
 We still spend too much too imprison those who commit non-violent offenses.
 
 
 
 Education spending should remain in the hands of local voters, who are best qualified to make local decisions. Local voters should decide whether to tax themselves more or less to fund their local schools.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"Three gun bills passed in 2018. Two bills, taking guns from people deemed to be at risk to themselves or others and from those involved in domestic assaults (following due process), were nearly unanimous. 
 
 
 
 The third bill, which restricted the purchase of firearms by those under 21, was more controversial. The bill did not actually ban those under 21 from buying firearms. Someone under 21 can buy a firearm if they:
 
 
 
 -Serve in the military.
 
 -Serve as a law enforcement officer.
 
 -Take a Vermont hunter safety course.
 
 -Take an NRA shooting range course.
 
 
 
 People under 21 may also accept a gun from a parent or grandparent. In short, an under-21 buyer must demonstrate competency through training or get the approval of someone who knows them and believes they will act responsibly. It's far from perfect, but somewhat safer than the current law.
 
 
 
 The bill also included prohibitions on magazine capacity. This section was too complicated and difficult to enforce. I voted to remove that section.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","I represent the only Senate district in Vermont without a traffic light. We are rural! My priority for Orange County is to maintain a healthy economic core. This requires good schools and proper broadband access. 
 
 
 
 Except for EC Fiber territory and some villages, Orange County is underserved. Small rural towns attract: former visitors who want to work or retire here; college students who wish to stay in Vermont after graduation; and Vermonters who left home to attend college, seek employment, or serve in the military. This last group often returns to Vermont with an out-of-state spouse, knowing that Vermont communities raise successful children. But they will only settle where there is proper broadband.

I am a big proponent of transparency in pricing, so consumers can have more educated cost effective choice in providers, prescriptions and supplies. I also sponsored the recently enacted Canadian drug re-importation bill along with several other Senators.

Having said that, there are several areas of cost containment that should be addressed. Cost  containment through Act 46 - consolidation of school districts- is working, but will take time. Moreover, at the same time, it can and will improve quality and opportunities for our students. Similarly, we must, 
 and have passed laws this year, to begin restructuring special education, which is very costly in its present form. Perhaps most important is that too much of school resources are now being devoted to social services and counseling and less to traditional education. At the very least, these services should be paid for by the General Fund and not by local property taxes. Similarly, I would be in favor of making our education financing system more progressive by having local education property taxes more income sensitized.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","As a long time advocate for low and middle income seniors on fixed incomes throughout Vermont, I have seen the problems poverty presents on many fronts.

We need to focus on prevention and earlier intervention that is clinically and developmentally appropriate, especially when it comes to mental health and misuse of substances. People (adults and children) need to be able to access timely supports and services when they need mental health treatment, and not be waiting in hospital emergency departments that are not equipped to meet their needs. Alternative therapies for pain management should be promoted and covered by insurance. Health insurance needs to be less complicated to navigate, acquire, and maintain. Individuals and families need to be able to access health, mental health, and dentistry resources, especially when they live in rurally isolated areas.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","We must focus more on the quality of Vermont education, not just the cost of it. We need to promote innovative teaching and learning that maximizes the promise of all Vermont students. We need to learn from the lessons of Act 46 –“ primarily that a top-down decision from Montpelier won't work everywhere, and local taxpayers' budget decisions must be respected. Full service and community schools should be part of Vermont's health care reform efforts. Students with disabilities should receive what they are entitled to more consistently---Multi-tiered Systems of Support are great in theory, but we need to ensure accountability to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Agency of Human Services and the Agency of Education must work together in a more coordinated way, utilizing Coordinated Services Plans more effectively. Pre-K should be an integral part of public education, and students with special needs should have equitable and timely access to what they need, sooner.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I would listen to low-income Vermonters and the people who work with them most closely to hear what they think would be most helpful to them, then do my best to make it happen. I would support better-paying jobs, better transportation, more safe and affordable housing options, and better health care that emphasizes prevention and earlier intervention. I would work to see that people have better access to food, especially if Vermont SNAP benefits are reduced by the Feds. We need to focus on meaningful economic and job development and determine how to make caregiving in our increasingly aging state a livable wage professional option, perhaps as part of health care reform. I would work to see that more peer-to-peer supports are utilized to help people where they are. I would reinforce the AHS Field Services presence in the 12 AHS districts so that services are better integrated/more effective for people, and state/nonprofit collaborations are maximized in service to those who need it most.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"First, we need a clear-eyed look at what is working, and how we are/are not investing in that. We need to look at desired outcomes and the best practices to achieve them and be certain that we are not just doing what we have always done, or what is the latest thing. We need to reinforce resources for the most vulnerable Vermonters: the impoverished, the youngest, the elderly, and people with significant disabilities. We need to invest more in mental health and substance issues, and do it preventively in coordination with health care initiatives. We need to create and maintain livable wage employment opportunities that draw and keep new residents here, especially younger ones. We need to invest in our working landscapes and our waterways in a way that is helpful and sustainable. And by raising our minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour, we can save substantial amounts of money from current public spending programs.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I applaud Governor Scott's decisions to support public health and public safety in response to America's gun violence epidemic, and especially the thwarted school shooting here in Vermont in February.

This means that I will work diligently to identify better ways to pay for what Vermonters need as they define it. I will strive to support efforts that improve safe and affordable housing, access to transportation and health care, nutritious food, clean water, innovative quality education pre-K through post-secondary, and meaningful jobs that afford a good quality of life. And, coming from an all-too-often overlooked corner of rural Vermont, I know that we can't offer these improvements just to folks living in Chittenden County.

There is virtually no choice at all. Once upon a time, Vermont had 18 insurance companies competing for consumers and since that time, coverage has gotten worse and costs have spiraled. I cannot think of an area where lack of choice is more inappropriate than in one's own health care needs.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","We have 89, 000 students enrolled at Vermont's public schools, and 361 school districts...an average of 260 students per district. While Vermont has good education outcomes. we also have one of the highest per pupil expenditures of any state...and 4th out of 50 for taxation. We need to find greater efficiencies in education. Cutting administrative overhead is a good start.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Improving the economy here in Vermont would be a great service to low-income Vermonters, by every measure. Those who want to work could find better paying jobs and a greater variety of employment. Those who can't would find Vermont in a better financial position to offer services to low-income Vermonters who need our help. Right now, our state is ranked 48th in business, streamlining the ability of those in the state to conduct business would go miles toward low-income folks in the state.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"There may be no other area of spending with a more meaningful result than in the area of mitigating and ending addictions, especially with opioids. We need additional treatment centers and facilities to end this public health crisis and move those afflicted from that lifestyle to a more productive and healthy one. 
 
 The least effective spending in state government in Vermont may be in the area of school administration. Vermont ranks second highest in the country for per pupil spending in administrative overhead at $1, 296.00, ranking only behind Washington D.C. Vermont is nearly twice the national average.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"Vermont has a long standing tradition of responsible gun ownership, self-defense and personal hunting. Firearms are important to our state and the Second Amendment is important to me. I recognize that in some cases, firearms may pose a danger to the public, when in the wrong hands. To that end, I did support the Extreme Risk Protection Orders which allow the authorities to review the situation when firearms may pose such a risk.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","Going around the state and talking to Vermonters about my proposals, I have found one that most folks really like is what I call Zero to One, where the State focuses on facilitating small businesses to make the decision to move from zero employees to just one, or to add just one additional employee. If we could make that happen, Vermont would add 50,000 jobs or more....that would make a huge difference to our economy and the well-being of all Vermonters.",paul-dame

Most people in the state don't know it's happening but the University of Vermont Medical Center is now the hub of a vast conglomerate of health care providers; it's not putting too fine a point on it to say that the Network aspires to be the single network/provider in the state. That could be a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on how the Network treats its patients (price) and staff (wages). The stand-off with the the University of Vermont nurses is a negative case in point, and points to the need for rigorous oversight going forward.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","As chair of Ed, I've had a hand in some very large changes over the last few years. We're in the endgame of Act 46; that should be managed in a way that's fair to districts that have already consolidated, but acknowledges our state's tradition of small schools. We remade the special education system with a long comprehensive Act this past year -- that will need to be tweaked and strengthened as it goes into effect over the next five years. But more than any other change, I will continue to push for a more fully income-based system to fund education. Singling out education and pairing it with the property tax is a recipe for continuing demonization of educators, schools and taxpayers who vote up their school budgets.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I believe we should quickly re-pass our minimum wage and paid family leave bills. Putting more money in the pockets of low-income Vermonters, in the form of earned wages, benefits everyone in the system, and the bill is phased to allow small businesses the time to adjust. Paid family leave is a fantastic deal for low-income individuals, many of whom would pay less than $100 a year, but suddenly have access to weeks of paid leave in the event of a pregnancy or family emergency.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I don't think it's possible to answer that question outside the equation of the entire budget, in any given year. But I will say that state colleges and child care providers have been starved nearly to the point of collapse, and I always look for ways to increase support to both.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I pushed gun safety for five years, and the opposition was brutal. At various points, I had to shut down my social media, and warn my family about the situation. But every year, the gun safety side of the discussion has grown in converts, and by the time Parkland and Fair Haven happened, we were seeing massive protests in favor of sensible gun reforms. My Universal Background Checks bill became law, as did a slate of other commonsense changes: age restrictions on purchase, a ban on bumpstocks and high-capacity magazines, a ""red flag"" law to remove guns from those who pose an extreme risk of violence. So if you look at the photo of Governor Phil Scott signing S55, you'll see exactly where I stand: at the Governor's shoulder, applauding.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","The State Board of Education was tasked with figuring out which small schools should be allowed to keep their Small School Grants; they issued some metrics, but indicated that they were unhappy with their own work. So making sure that small schools retain the resources they need to not merely survive but thrive -- assuming they've met the spirit of Act 46 -- I'd regard as a top priority. Small schools are not our curse in Vermont; they're our salvation. And the larger districts promoted by the Act represent our best chance to save as many of them as possible.",phil-baruth

Recently married my longtime partner of 13 years.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","We need to pull in the reins on the cost of health care. In order to do that we will have to address the administrator's salaries, the high cost of drugs, a single payer system such as medicare for all, and opening the borders for fair medication purchases. 
 
We also need to stop the spread of the drug abuse in the state. I include tobacco products in this category. Far to many productive people are lost to this problem. The answer is not to put people in jail, it's to put people in programs that will show them their worth in society. In order to do this we need to make sure the money flows equally to rural Vermont and the large cities. 
 
Stress is huge health risk for Vermonters. High cost of living has to come down. I'd start with my proposal to completely rework the DMV and inspection system. I will also propose starting our own state airline which I have shown would completely fund the school system and cut our property taxes by 50 percent. Stress Reduction=Better Health.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I think the dance is started in looking at our schools, but cuts to programs benefiting kids is not the answer. My state-owned airline proposal will take care of the money part of this problem. It will also show new businesses we are serious about making Vermont a place they can settle and create jobs for our residents. This will also bring in new families/students to our school system so that schools will be able to stay open and our teachers will remain employed. 
 
 
 
 I'm not in favor of consolidating schools, but I am in favor of reducing costs in the administration of districts that are in the same general area. What works for one rural area will probably work for another, however, mixing rural and city areas won't work. 
 
 
 
 We also need to make sure every kid has the opportunity to participate in PE and Music/Arts. It's a proven fact that kids who are active in these areas do better in school. Let's love our kids enough to help them succeed.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","I'd push hard to get more businesses looking at relocating here. Again, my airline proposal will do that. Until we get this established we will have the problem of people needing assistance. 
 
I have a proposal for how we can utilize our dilapidated houses spotting the countryside in order to provide housing for all needy Vermonters. It will also help these homeowners retain their houses until they sell, thus avoid losing them to tax auctions. 
 
 
Senior citizens are often the most vulnerable. We need to freeze all taxes on seniors when they reach 65 or are unable to work due to a verified disability. 
 
 
health care needs to be expanded for those in desperate situations. Food assistance needs to be protected for families that are unable to provide for their kids. However, all programs should be carefully monitored with the goal to move those capable of helping themselves off of any assistance they currently receive. I believe that helping them move forward is best for all.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"The DMV/inspections is a huge waste of money and is just another tax on Vermonters. We must move to a more efficient way of keeping our roads/drivers safe. My proposal will do this, and put more money in the pockets of our residents.
 
 
Our infrastructure is a mess, just like the rest of the country. Maybe chain-gangs are a thing of the past but we can certainly institute a training program for qualified inmates and minor offenders that will start rebuilding Vermont. 
 
 
Emphasis needs to be placed on bringing in quality businesses to Vermont. The increased revenue from more people, more business, will help fix many of our economic problems. Until then we need to tighten our belts on government waste. I'm saying if we as families have to nickel an dime it, then the government needs to do the same. Every expense needs to be adjusted to become reasonable. Rather than a department saying they need $50,000 they will need to say they need $46,363.21, and show why.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"When we love our guns more than we love our kids there is a serious problem. I expect many won't read past my next statement, but this is how I feel.
 
 
Guns DO KILL PEOPLE. The NRA would have you believe otherwise.
 
 
Let me confuse you. I like shooting. 
 
 
My proposal:
 
Pass the background checks and go through a waiting period:
 
 1. Own one double action handgun with a limit of six rounds.
 
 2. Own a pump, lever, or bolt action rifle or shotgun with a limit of 6 rounds. 3 rounds for the shotgun.
 
 3. You can keep any guns you currently own as long as you are not convicted of a crime, including domestic violence.
 
 4. State sanctioned shooting ranges will be set up to allow anyone who passes the background checks to go rent a gun and ammunition.
 
 
The current laws passed are a good start, but don't go far enough. They pussyfoot around the subject. Let's love our kids more than our guns!","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","My first priority will be keeping Vermonters comfortably in their homes, well fed, and relieved of much of their economic stress. And I'm referring to all Vermonters, including kids, and transplants to the area. I'll do that by pushing my DMV and airline proposal hard, right out of the gate. I'm well versed on both of these subjects and believe they can be instituted by methodically picking away at the current ways things are done. 
 
 
I believe stress is the #1 reason people feel Vermont is not a place they can stay. It clouds the beauty of our Green Mountains and dashes the hopes and dreams of so many who call this wonderful state home. 
 
 
 
 I'm not a career politician. Hell, I'm not even a politician. But I am someone who calls Vermont home. My two adult daughters are born Vermonters, but they no longer live here. They went where the money was. 
 
 
 
 I'm asking you to send me to Montpelier so that I can make a lot of noise on your behalf. That's something I can certainly do!",ron-horton

Through my work at the Open Door Clinic and PPNNE, I know first-hand that many Vermonters struggle to access health care. I am in favor of advancing Universal Primary Care for all Vermonters, including access to mental health, addiction prevention and treatment, reproductive, and dental health services. These primary care services should be locally accessible and welcoming for all Vermonters. I know that health care is a huge cost for families and individuals, our state and local governments, small businesses and nonprofit organizations, and large employers too. As an experienced public finance & budget professional, I am committed to working toward a financially responsible solution to delivering healthcare to all Vermonters.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","We need to ensure our schools are more equitable, student-focused, and sustainable. As a school board leader, I advocated for right-sized budgets that invested in student support systems, expanded curriculum, fair compensation, bias-free schools, and energy efficient facilities. We streamlined governance and targeted reductions to areas with declining enrollments where efficiencies were most feasible. We need similar approaches statewide, while also respecting inclusive local decision-making and celebrating our public schools and educators. We must better support our higher education system and improve student access. Too few Vermont students complete a college degree because we don't adequately invest in our state colleges and students. We need to better integrate technical education into high schools and ensure relevant investments in workforce development and training. We need to ensure Vermonters have better access to affordable, high-quality early childhood education and infant care.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","many low-income Vermonters do not have sufficient access to the tools necessary to maintain meaningful employment, support their families, and live healthy lives, such as adequate housing, child care, transportation, and healthy foods. I would work to pass legislation that expands affordable housing options near town centers with access to employment and services. I would work on rural public transportation systems to enable people without cars to get to work, appointments, and shopping. I would explore options to expand school lunch programs to cover non-school days and additional family members. I would prioritize the passage of a paid family leave program so family members can be together during times of illness or the arrival of a new child without the financial stress. I would work to expand child care options close to parents' places of employment. I would support fair, adequate, and equitable wages for all employees.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"I know there are areas in our state budget which should be increased or decreased, but until I am able to more intimately analyze the budget I can't say for certain where. I am a budget ""geek"" and have worked on budgets of all sizes and purpose. I was a fiscal analyst for the WI Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the equivalent of Vermont's Joint Fiscal Office, covering K-12 and higher education. State budgets are not easily understood from the outside. They are not abstract political games. State budgets are complex expressions of our collective public priorities. I will work with colleagues to identify budget efficiencies, like I did as a school board member and a Middlebury College budget staffer. I also believe the way to fuel change is to target investments where they'll have a big impact, to programs that support people, families, and communities in meaningful ways. I can't wait to dig into the state budget with colleagues to create responsible, effective state budgets.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"I support the gun violence prevention legislation passed this session. Gun violence in America is a public health epidemic. In Vermont, most gun deaths are the result of suicide and domestic violence. Vermont is also not immune to the proliferation of school shootings. Misogyny, hate, and multi-generational domestic abuse have fueled gun-related violence to the point where many people do not feel safe in their homes or schools. Legislation to prevent access to firearms for individuals who are prone to harm themselves or others is vital. I grew up in a home where my brother owned guns for hunting and target practice. I support my friends and neighbors who use firearms responsibly. I know hunting and gun sports are part of our culture and history, and I commit to learning more from people for whom this tradition is important. I also firmly believe that the right of people to feel safe in their homes, schools, workplaces, and communities outweighs the blanket right to possess weapons.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","As a mother and feminist, my priorities would begin with advocating for policy changes that improve the lives and status of women in our state, including paid family leave, improved access to high-quality child care, fair and equitable pay, domestic violence prevention, comprehensive sexual harassment policies, job training in high paying sectors, student loan reduction, access to capital, and bias and discrimination prevention and reparation. Nationally, 25 percent of elected officials are women, and research shows that when women are at the table, women's perspectives and priorities are better addressed. Communities thrive when women thrive. Policies and programs that help Vermont women help all Vermonters.",ruth-hardy

I grew up on the University of Vermont's campus as both my parents where coaches of the UVM Swimming and Diving team. Although I have always done Academically well, such as in my Micro and Macro economic classes at UVM, my pride leans towards the places I have worked and the people I have met. I have worked as a janitor, a lifeguard, a camp counselor, and a safety monitor, all which taught be new and valuable skills.
 
 I have always had an interest in government and politics. At first, like most beginners, I followed along on issues others said. With time and practice I slowly found myself forming my own opinions and with even more time I could fluently give my own answers to issues I saw and suggest actions. I love Vermont but it has its flaws and I truly believe that I should not complain unless I try fixing it. I now have an opportunity to help try to fix situations or at the very least offer a different perspective.",https://www.vtdigger.org/images/candidates/SethCournoyer.jpg,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,"What changes, if any, would you make to improve healthcare for Verm…","I have talked with many businesses big and small, one of the most common issues is they are struggling to give employees good healthcare insurance. Healthcare is no simple issue but there are things we can do to fix it. There is a severe lack of competition in the healthcare market, this is due in part because of Government. Although many laws surrounding healthcare sound good it they make it virtually impossible to start a healthcare business. Without competition in the market we don't know prices. How much does an X-Ray scan cost, does another place have them cheaper?
 
 Health Insurance also suffers from a lack of competition but more specifically individualized plans. Vermont requires 46 mandates be covered by insurance, one of which is Naturopathic Treatment, this raises the cost of insurance.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","I am a huge advocate for the school choice system. Every student is different in the best way they learn, so they should be allowed to choose what education is best suited for them instead of being forced to go to their local school because they cannot afford anywhere else. The money for education should go to the students' heads which follows them to the school of their choice.
 
 I am also a big supporter of Tech Schools along with Big Picture Programs which help teach real world skills along with individualize education.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","Local communities are best at helping individual situations as they certainly are closer to the Vermonters problem compared to State Government. It is also important to note that Charities are a thousand times better at helping those in need than government programs. This is due to a lot of funding for government programs go to those running the programs. If anything, I would be more in favor of government putting the money towards the charities instead of running its own program. 
 
 Now government should be addressing what is hurting many low-income Vermonters. The current cost of living and high prices damages low-income Vermonters and raising taxes, even if to help low-income Vermonters, only increases this problem.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"We spend a supposed $699 million on transportation, some of which is used in other areas than roads, compared to New Hampshire's $238 million. It's not breaking news to say that New Hampshire's roads are so much better than Vermont's. In general, we need to decrease spending in a lot of different sectors. We spend 1.7 billion on many welfare programs that are better done by charities. I think there is a common misconception that spending less means worse programs, but sometimes it is the exact opposite. The Private market does almost everything better than the government.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"As someone who was at Fort Lauderdale airport with the UVM swim team during the horrific shooting (I would rather not the being part of that horrific event be in the article unless it was separate and more in-depth because I don't want to do light to the event and make it seem like I am using it for political gain), I stand against it, not only do I feel that certain parts violate the Bill of Rights, but that it avoids the major issue these horrific events such as school shootings. Teen depression, suicide, and anxiety are higher than they have ever been, what is causing this crisis in my generation. The guns have always been here, something else has changed and we are avoiding it for a persevered sort term solution.","What will be your priority issue if elected, and what will you do to address it?","The state of Vermont's economy. The cost of living in Vermont is outstandingly high, rent and housing are some of the highest costs across country, this is impart do to the ridiculous cost of development our state puts on developers. Due to the high cost of living it is hard for many businesses to find workers, our low unemployment rate, this leads businesses to raise prices so they can offer higher wages, this hurts low-income workers on salaries as products just increased in price, the wage-price spiral.

Every Vermonter should be able to access basic and adequate health care as a matter of law. Second, I would build upon efforts from last session to drive down the wholesale cost of Rx meds by using the state's purchasing power to bargain better rates. I am open to joining with other states to maximize the return on investment Vermont enjoys. I also believe that permitting consumers to join Co-operatives for the purpose of purchasing prescription drugs is worth exploring. I also would explore the costs and relative lack of transparencies in medical devices and how they are priced. I find this lack of transparency deeply disturbing as a medical practitioner. In general, it should be easier for Vermonters to comparison shop for medical care.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","So, I worry that elders are ""house poor."" That is to say they are on the verge of being taxed out of our communities. In past years, efforts to introduce greater income sensitivity have provided some relief, but we need to move to a school funding formula which primarily is funded through the income tax in order to provide some relief to elders. Sens. Pollina and Pearson have such a bill, I look forward to supporting it should I be elected...
 
Also, I believe we need to do more to capture of the intellectual capital our state produces. any Vermonter who wishes to work for seven years in Vermont post graduation should have their tuition payments capped at 3.25 percent. (This formula is similar to a program the state of Oregon put in place, and while the numbers may need to be tweaked the basic principle remains). Tuition payments could be deducted like a payroll tax avoiding student loan defaults. Student loan default has become the second largest area of consumer debt for most Americans.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","It appears increasingly obvious that the private sector is not willing or capable of providing high-speed internet to much of rural Vermont. It may be necessary to explore what role the State might play in facilitating internet connectivity to all corners of our state-
 
I also support an increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit. EITC allows working Vermonters to shelter the first several thousand dollars of earnings from the income tax if you make under a certain amount annually. 
 
In addition, I believe that an increase in the minimum wage and the tipped minimum wage both would create upward pressure on wages and so I support a measured approach that would see the wage rise over time.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"In general I believe in good economic times, the State should spend less, and in poorer economic times the State should spend more. Right now, we are in a period where major capital expenditures were postponed indefinitely and failing to address those concerns has created a severe backlog, not to mention serious safety issues. Spending has to be principled and proportionate based on what we truly can afford, but right now given the status of our infrastructure, a certain amount of spending is necessary and prudent.",Where do you stand on the package of gun bills passed this session?,"In general, I am fine with what passed. I feel no need to re-negotiate that moment in time, rather I am interested in discussing school safety. I am also interested in sitting with law enforcement and prosecutors to see how well exciting law works for them. Does it provide them the resources they need in the field and the courthouse?

We need to continue to do so to avoid more costly hospitalizations.
 
We need to continue to work to rebuild a true system of mental health. The strain our fractured system puts on hospitals, schools, and communities is the result of decades of neglect.
 
We need to make sure Vermont's health care ""system"" exists to serve the needs of patients, not the other way around. Every patient deserves to be empowered to get the best care at the best price possible.","What changes, if any, would you make to improve Vermont's educatio…","The next major effort must be to better understand the growth in human services spending in our school budgets. Schools have increasingly taken on social workers, psychologists and similar positions in order to meet the non-instructional needs of students. So in a way our education system is now paying for education AND human services. Getting a handle on these services and determining if there is a more appropriate way to deliver and pay for them is, I believe, the single most substantial opportunity to relieve pressure on school budgets and taxpayers.","What would you do to help low-income Vermonters, in both rural and urban areas?","We need to raise the minimum wage to more fairly compensate Vermonters at the lower end of the wage scale. I have voted for a schedule of wage increases to $15/hour and will do so again. No other action, in my opinion, would do more to improve the economic situation for tens of thousands of Vermonters.
 I also believe we need to take bold action to provide meaningful work and service opportunities to young Vermonters throughout the state. Programs like the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps provide important skills and work readiness for young people. I believe EVERY kid in Vermont who wants such an experience should have the chance. This is especially critical for kids from families who do not have connections, or who need extra support to get off to successful starts as young adults. This would require pooling together labor and workforce funds, and making participation as bureaucratically simple as possible.",Where do you think state spending should be increased/decreased?,"We need more spending on primary health care services, which should reduce the amount we spend on hospital services.
 
We should raise the minimum wage which will result in reduced public benefit costs.
 
We should do everything possible to make the recently passed prescription drug reimportation bill a reality so we can dramatically reduce state spending on prescriptions.

The budget is the most important bill we write each year and the most important vote we cast. This year the Senate passed a very strong budget that grew less than the rate of inflation. We were able to reverse the Governor's proposed cuts to the most vulnerable like his proposed elimination of services for people with serious disabilities like quadriplegia. We were able to reverse his proposal to make health insurance less affordable to 6100 households. And we initiated proposals to grow the economy and support Vermont's small businesses.

Collecting students in a centralized education factory, effective in the 19th century, denies the reality that education is easily distributed electronically. Consolidating children drains the teachers and education professionals from rural Vermont leaving local volunteer board and commission positions empty. Expanding and improving high-speed internet and cellular service brings the world of knowledge to every person's lap. Expanding world access is essential to attract young families with children and the employers who hire them. It reverses the declining local school population. Early child care and education up to age three will socially and intellectually prepare children for the 21st century.

Recognition that many social conditions now considered moral failures are actually medical illnesses or societal failures. Non-violent criminal convictions need to be undisclosed or erased.

Cars used by terrorists with gas tanks limited to 10 gallons are still cars. Assault styled weapon ban proposals: another feel-good. Banning red cars are still cars.
